## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-03

- Baseline release-contract anchor for the existing 2.1.0 marketplace
  (flat `skills/` layout, `once: true` hook support). Establishes the
  version-sync + changelog contract validated by the `release` CI check
  (#2913). Earlier history predates this changelog.
