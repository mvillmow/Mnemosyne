## How to Contribute a Skill

### Option 1: Automatic via `/learn` (Recommended)

The easiest way to contribute is using the `/learn` command after a valuable session:

1. Complete an experiment, debugging session, or development task.
2. Run `/learn` in your Claude Code session.
3. Claude automatically:
   - Reads your entire conversation history.
   - Extracts successes, failures, and parameters.
   - Auto-generates a skill filename: `<topic>-<subtopic>-<short-4-word-summary>`.
   - Creates a branch (`skill/<name>`), commits, pushes, and opens a PR.
4. Review and merge the PR.

### Option 2: Manual Creation

1. Copy the template: `templates/skill-template.md`
2. Save as `skills/<name>.md` (lowercase, kebab-case).
3. Fill in the YAML frontmatter (see [Skill Structure](#skill-structure) below).
4. Fill in all required markdown sections.
5. Optionally create `skills/<name>.notes.md` for raw session details.
6. Create a PR following the [branch conventions](#branch-and-commit-conventions).

## Skill Structure

All skills are flat markdown files in the `skills/` directory with YAML frontmatter.

```text
skills/<name>.md             # Main skill file with YAML frontmatter + markdown content
skills/<name>.notes.md       # (Optional) Additional context from development session
```

### Required YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-here
description: "Use when: (1) specific condition, (2) another condition"
category: training
date: 2026-03-24
version: "1.0.0"
user-invocable: false
tags: [optional, searchable, keywords]
---
```

| Field | Description |
| ------- | ------------- |
| `name` | Lowercase, kebab-case identifier |
| `description` | Trigger conditions with specific use cases |
| `category` | One of the 9 approved categories (see below) |
| `date` | Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `version` | Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0") |
| `user-invocable` | Set to `false` for internal/sub-skills |
| `tags` | (Optional) Searchable keywords array |

### Required Markdown Sections

Every skill must include:

1. **Overview table** -- Date, objective, outcome.
2. **When to Use** -- Specific trigger conditions.
3. **Verified Workflow** -- Step-by-step instructions that worked, including a Quick Reference subsection.
4. **Failed Attempts table (REQUIRED)** -- Must include columns: Attempt, What Was Tried, Why It Failed, Lesson Learned.
5. **Results & Parameters** -- Copy-paste ready configs and expected outputs.

### Filename Convention

```
<topic>-<subtopic>-<short-4-word-summary>.md
```

All lowercase, kebab-case. Examples:
- `mojo-parametric-dtype-migration.md`
- `docker-pixi-isolation.md`
- `batch-subprocess-signal-hang.md`

## Quality Standards

1. **Specific descriptions**: Include trigger conditions, not vague summaries. Descriptions should specify *when* to use the skill (e.g., "Use when: (1) encountering vLLM weight sync errors, (2) setting up multi-GPU GRPO training").
2. **Failures required**: Every skill must document what did not work and why. The Failed Attempts table is mandatory.
3. **Copy-paste ready**: Parameters, configurations, and commands should work immediately when copied.
4. **No duplication**: Link to external docs instead of copying content. If a skill overlaps with an existing one, extend rather than duplicate.

## Categories

| Category | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `training` | ML training experiments and hyperparameters |
| `evaluation` | Model evaluation and metrics |
| `optimization` | Performance tuning and speedups |
| `debugging` | Bug investigation and fixes |
| `architecture` | Design decisions and patterns |
| `tooling` | Automation and developer tools |
| `ci-cd` | Pipeline configurations and CI fixes |
| `testing` | Test strategies and patterns |
| `documentation` | Paper writing, academic reviews, knowledge docs |

## Branch and Commit Conventions

### Branch Naming

- **Skills (automatic)**: `skill/<name>` (e.g., `skill/mojo-parametric-dtype-migration`)
- **Fixes**: `fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>` (e.g., `fix/913-contributing-changelog`)
- **Features**: `feat/<short-description>`

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Common types:
- `feat:` -- New skill or feature
- `fix:` -- Bug fix or correction
- `docs:` -- Documentation changes
- `chore:` -- Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add mojo-parametric-dtype-migration skill
fix: resolve skill validation issues and missing frontmatter fields
docs: update migration status - 100% complete
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch following the naming conventions above.
2. Make your changes (add skill files, fix issues, etc.).
3. Run validation locally before pushing (see [Validation](#validation)).
4. Push your branch and create a PR.
5. CI will automatically validate:
   - YAML frontmatter has required fields.
   - All required markdown sections are present.
   - Failed Attempts section exists.
   - Description is specific (20+ characters).
   - Category is valid.
6. Once CI passes and the PR is approved, it will be merged.

### Merge queue readiness

The required-check workflow supports GitHub merge groups, but queue activation
is a separate Odysseus-owned operation. See
[`docs/ci/merge-queue.md`](docs/ci/merge-queue.md) for the policy artifact,
trigger boundaries, and post-merge evidence required by issue #3115. Until that
evidence is recorded, enabling auto-merge does not prove a pull request entered
the queue.

## Validation

All PRs are validated by CI. Run validation locally before submitting:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_plugins.py
```

The validator checks:
- Required frontmatter fields are present and valid.
- All required markdown sections exist.
- Failed Attempts table is included.
- Description meets minimum length (20+ characters).
- Category is one of the 9 approved values.

## Code Style

### Markdown

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers (e.g., ` ```bash`, ` ```yaml`).
- Use tables for structured data (overview, failed attempts, verified-on).
- Keep lines readable; no strict line length limit, but aim for clarity.

### YAML Frontmatter

- Use lowercase kebab-case for the `name` field.
- Quote string values that contain special characters.
- Use arrays for `tags`.

### General Principles

This project follows these development principles:

- **KISS**: Keep it simple. Do not add complexity when a simpler solution works.
- **YAGNI**: Do not add features until they are required.
- **DRY**: Do not duplicate functionality, data structures, or algorithms.
- **POLA**: Create intuitive and predictable interfaces.

## Cross-Repository Compatibility

Skills should be generic enough to work across multiple repositories:

1. **No `source:` in frontmatter** -- Do not include repository-specific source fields.
2. **Use placeholders** -- Replace hardcoded paths with `<project-root>`, `<test-path>`, `<package-manager>`.
3. **Add a "Verified On" section** -- Document where the skill was validated:
   ```markdown
   ## Verified On

   | Project | Context | Details |
   |---------|---------|---------|
   | ProjectName | PR #XXX context | [notes.md](../skills/skill-name.notes.md) |
   ```
4. **Move specifics to references** -- Put project-specific commands, paths, and code in a `.notes.md` file.
5. **Generic workflows** -- Write workflows that can be adapted to any repository structure.

## Releasing

The skills corpus is released as a tagged snapshot. `pyproject.toml`
`[project].version` is the single source of truth.

1. Bump the version in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Add a matching `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Merge; the `release` CI check dry-runs
   `scripts/validate_release_contract.py` on every PR and `main` push.
4. Tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag -- `.github/workflows/release.yml` re-validates
   the contract against the tag and publishes a GitHub Release with the
   skills-corpus snapshot tarball and the changelog entry as notes.
