# Cross-Repo Migration: Verify Issue Inventory Before Planning

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-20 |
| **Objective** | Cover the full migration lifecycle: verify the source inventory before a cross-repo move, reconcile every consumer after it, and retire stale scanner findings against exact historical paths without weakening the destination or manually dismissing alerts. |
| **Outcome** | (a) The issue's inventory/counts/ADR diverged from disk; the plan was rebuilt from verified ground truth. (b) Removing Hephaestus's migrated plugin source dirs alone turned `main` RED; PR #2070 reconciled orphaned consumers and restored green. (c) Issue #2255 supplied a proposed follow-up contract for 58 hosted findings against the retired roots; implementation and a fresh default-branch scan remain pending. |
| **Verification** | Mixed: the post-move orphan-consumer sweep is verified-ci (PR #2070, merged `7cc097d6`); the pre-move inventory check and #2255 scanner-alert closure workflow are proposed/unverified. |
| **History** | [changelog](./architecture-cross-repo-migration-verify-issue-inventory.history) |

## When to Use

- You are planning a file or package move that a GitHub issue names explicitly ("Files to Modify", "modules to move").
- The move crosses a git-submodule or independent-repo boundary (e.g. inside an Odysseus-style meta-repo).
- The issue cites ADR numbers, doc paths, or file/test counts you are about to copy into the plan.
- The destination repo's language, build system, or packaging capability is assumed rather than verified.
- A test directory tree looks single-language by name but may hold mixed-language files (Python + C++ GoogleTest).
- A public string-literal contract (NATS subject, wire field) sits inside code that is being moved or renamed.
- **You just removed the migrated source directories and need `main` to stay green** — a migration is only done when every CONSUMER (validators, tests, entry points, pre-commit hooks, CI workflows, docs, frozen-count/membership guards, whole test dirs) is reconciled, not when the source moves.
- A repo has "frozen" guards that assert a NUMBER (console-script count, symbol count) or a membership SET (sanctioned-dir allowlist, phantom-dir guard) — these silently encode the old surface and won't be caught by grepping for module names.
- A hosted scanner still reports findings under plugin roots that were deliberately removed
  during a cross-repo migration.
- You must prove that a retired local distribution stays absent while repository-level metadata
  stays at the root and runtime configuration points to an external marketplace.
- An alert batch has a claimed historical count/path mapping that must be reconciled exactly
  before accepting automatic scanner closure.

## Proposed Workflow

> **Warning:** This workflow has not been validated end-to-end. Treat as a hypothesis until CI confirms.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Verify every file the issue names actually exists
for f in src/keystone/maestro_client.py tests/test_maestro_client.py; do ls "$f" 2>&1; done
grep -rln 'maestro\|Maestro' src/ tests/ --include='*.py'   # confirm absence
# 2. Confirm cited ADRs exist; pick the next real number
ls docs/adr/
# 3. Classify test dirs by CONTENT, not name
ls tests/unit/   # .py or .cpp/.hpp?
# 4. Verify the destination can host the package
ls <dest>/pyproject.toml 2>&1; grep -n 'pypi-dependencies' <dest>/pixi.toml
# 5. Guard a frozen public contract literal
grep -rn '"hi.tasks.>"' <dest>/src
# 6. Scope acceptance grep to exclude same-named C++/build dirs
find <src>/src <src>/tests -name '*.py' -not -path '*/build*/*' -not -path '*/.worktrees/*'
```

### Detailed Steps (pre-planning checklist)

Treat the issue body's file inventory and ADR cross-references as a **hypothesis**. Verify every named file, ADR, and capability against disk *before* writing "Files to Modify". Flag every assumption you could not verify.

1. **`ls`/`grep` every file the issue names before writing it into the plan.** Issue inventories drift from disk. Issue #143 named `maestro_client.py` + `test_maestro_client.py` — neither exists. It said "10 modules / 12 tests"; disk had 10 `.py` source files (issue omitted `__main__.py`, invented `maestro_client.py`) and 11 test files (`test_daemon.py` existed but was unlisted; `test_maestro_client.py` listed but absent).
2. **Verify each cited ADR/doc exists; pick the next REAL sequential number.** The issue AND ProjectKeystone's own CLAUDE.md cited "ADR-015"; `ls docs/adr/` showed only 001–008. Use the next real number (009) and reference an ADR that actually exists (006).
3. **Classify mixed-language test dirs by file CONTENT, not directory name.** `tests/{unit,integration,e2e,load,fixtures,mocks}/` looked Pythonic but held C++ GoogleTest `.cpp`/`.hpp` that must STAY. Only top-level `tests/*.py` migrate. A naive `find tests -name '*.py'` or whole-dir `git mv` would mis-sweep or strand files.
4. **Verify the destination's build system/language/packaging before assuming "just add the package."** ProjectAgamemnon had ZERO Python (no `pyproject.toml`, no `[pypi-dependencies]` in `pixi.toml`, `src/` all `.cpp`) — so this was a from-scratch bootstrap, not an edit.
5. **Explicitly flag cross-repo history as NOT preserved by plain `git mv`.** `git mv` preserves `git log --follow` only WITHIN one repo. Keystone and Agamemnon are independent repos (submodules), so a copy-in + provenance commit does not give `--follow` across the boundary. True preservation needs `git filter-repo`/subtree — left out of scope, so flag it as the top unverified risk.
6. **Identify public string-literal contracts and add a grep-guard.** The NATS subject literal `hi.tasks.{team_id}.{task_id}.{event}` / `"hi.tasks.>"` must survive byte-for-byte (downstream Argus/AI-Maestro must not redeploy), and the dot-count parse arithmetic in `_parse_subject` must not change (`hi.tasks.team.task.event` = 5 parts). Guard these separately from the identifier rename.

### After retirement: reconcile hosted scanner alerts without dismissal

> **Warning:** This workflow is proposed from ProjectHephaestus issue #2255. It
> has not been executed end-to-end, merged, or confirmed by a fresh
> default-branch scan.

1. **Collect the live open-alert inventory before editing.** Filter by the exact
   scanner tool and save the evidence outside source paths. Fail closed unless
   every expected rule count and historical path is present. A claimed total is
   not enough: compare the full multiset of `(rule, path)` pairs.
2. **Reconcile repeated findings as a Cartesian product.** When a migrated
   distribution historically shipped the same payload at two roots, construct
   `expected_names × expected_roots` and compare the sorted paths for equality.
   This detects a missing expected alert, an unexpected extra skill, or a third
   scanner root that a count-only check hides.
3. **Reconcile singleton and doubled interface findings separately.** Manifest
   rules should map to the exact retired manifest paths; missing repository-file
   rules should map to the exact nested plugin-root paths. Do not combine them
   into one loose total.
4. **Encode the current topology, not the old payload.** Add a repository
   regression test that keeps every retired local plugin root absent, requires
   repository metadata at the real repository root, and parses the local runtime
   configuration to prove skills are enabled from the external marketplace.
   Marketplace configuration proves runtime sourcing; it does not itself clear
   findings in the source repository.
5. **Run the scanner against the source repository checkout.** Require zero
   current-checkout findings for the issue's exact rule set. Do not scan the
   destination marketplace and treat that as evidence about the source repo.
6. **Merge through the repository's normal protected workflow.** Then trigger
   the existing organization-managed scanner against the merged default branch.
   Do not add a repository workflow or scanner dependency solely to force this
   housekeeping rescan.
7. **Let a fresh authoritative scan close stale alerts.** Never manually dismiss
   an alert merely because its path is absent locally. If any matching alert
   survives or reappears, preserve it and investigate its live ref, path,
   category, configured root, and scan provenance.

### Scanner Alert Quick Reference

```bash
# Collect one scanner's open hosted findings as a single array.
mkdir -p build
gh api --paginate --slurp \
  "repos/<owner>/<source-repo>/code-scanning/alerts?state=open&tool_name=<scanner>&per_page=100" \
  > build/alert-pages.json

# Current-checkout proof must run from the SOURCE repository root.
plugin-scanner scan . --format json > build/plugin-scan.json
jq -e --argjson rules '["RULE_A", "RULE_B"]' \
  '[.findings[]? | select(.rule_id as $id | $rules | index($id))] | length == 0' \
  build/plugin-scan.json

# After merge/rescan, query the same source repository and exact rule set.
gh api --paginate --slurp \
  "repos/<owner>/<source-repo>/code-scanning/alerts?state=open&tool_name=<scanner>&per_page=100" |
jq -e --argjson rules '["RULE_A", "RULE_B"]' \
  'add | [.[] | select(.rule.id as $id | $rules | index($id))] | length == 0'
```

## Verified Workflow

> **Scope note:** The **pre-move inventory check** above (Proposed Workflow) is
> still planning-derived and unverified. The **post-move orphan-consumer sweep**
> below IS verified-ci: it was executed end-to-end on ProjectHephaestus ADR-016
> (issue #2063), landed as PR #2070 (merged `7cc097d6`), and returned `main` to
> green.

### After the move: chase EVERY dangling reference

A migration isn't done when the source moves — it's done when every CONSUMER of
the moved surface is reconciled. ProjectHephaestus ADR-016 moved the skill/plugin
surface (`skills/`, `plugins/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/`,
`assets/`) out to a new "Athena" repo. Removing the source dirs alone turned
`main` RED because these consumer classes still pointed at the deleted surface.
After deleting the migrated dirs, sweep for ALL of them:

1. **Modules** that import/validate the moved surface — e.g. removed
   `hephaestus/validation/{skill_catalog,repo_analyze_skills,skill_merge_method}.py`.
2. **Test files** importing those modules — removed 5 orphaned test files, and
   *reconciled* 4 more that imported a now-deleted symbol
   (`test_validation_shim_parity.py`, `test_validation_parser_usage.py`,
   `test_validation_parser.py`, `test_validation_cli_contracts.py` — dropped the
   `skill_catalog` import + its one test each, rather than deleting the whole
   file).
3. **Entry points** in `pyproject.toml` — removed 2 console-script entries, then
   updated the frozen console-script COUNT assertion a test asserts (53 → 51).
4. **Pre-commit hooks** — removed 3 hooks that invoked deleted scripts.
5. **CI workflows** — removed `.github/workflows/hol-plugin-scanner.yml` + its
   `.plugin-scanner.toml` config + the workflow-README row that listed it.
6. **Docs** — removed `COMPATIBILITY.md` rows referencing the removed surface.
7. **Test-infrastructure allowlists** — `SANCTIONED_EXTRA_TEST_DIRS` in
   `tests/unit/validation/test_structure.py` still listed `"plugins"`; a
   *separate* phantom-test-dir guard then failed until that entry was removed.
8. **The whole removed test dir** — `tests/unit/plugins/`.

**Frozen-count / membership assertions are the sneaky ones.** They don't
reference the moved surface *by name*, so a grep for module identifiers misses
them — they assert a NUMBER (console-script count 53→51) or a membership SET
(`SANCTIONED_EXTRA_TEST_DIRS`, the phantom-dir guard) that the migration
silently changed. Search for them explicitly.

**Detection method that works:**

- After deleting the migrated dirs, grep the **ENTIRE tree** for the removed
  module names, script paths, workflow names, and directory names — not just the
  obvious call sites.
- Run the **FULL** test suite locally, not just the changed files: tree-wide
  guards (whole-tree `mypy`, structure tests, phantom-dir guards) fail *far from
  the deletion*, so a changed-files-only run reports green while `main` is red.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# After deleting the migrated dirs (skills/ plugins/ .claude-plugin/ ...),
# sweep the ENTIRE tree for every class of dangling reference:
DIRS='skills|plugins|.claude-plugin|.codex-plugin|.agents|assets'
MODS='skill_catalog|repo_analyze_skills|skill_merge_method'   # deleted module names
# 1. modules/tests importing deleted modules
grep -rn -E "$MODS" --include='*.py' .
# 2. deleted dir names referenced anywhere (allowlists, guards, docs, workflows)
grep -rn -E "\"($DIRS)\"|/($DIRS)/" .
# 3. entry points + the frozen COUNT that a test asserts
grep -n 'console_scripts\|\[project.scripts\]' pyproject.toml
grep -rn -E 'len\(.*scripts.*\)\s*==|== *5[0-9]' tests/    # frozen count assertion
# 4. pre-commit hooks invoking deleted scripts
grep -n -E "$MODS|$DIRS" .pre-commit-config.yaml
# 5. workflows scanning the moved surface
grep -rln -E "$DIRS" .github/workflows/
# 6. membership allowlists / phantom-dir guards
grep -rn 'SANCTIONED_EXTRA_TEST_DIRS' tests/
# 7. run the FULL suite (tree-wide guards fail far from the deletion)
pixi run mypy && pixi run pytest tests/unit
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Trusted the issue's "10 modules / 12 tests" counts and wrote them straight into "Files to Modify". | Disk had 10 `.py` sources / 11 test files; the issue omitted `__main__.py` and `test_daemon.py` and invented `maestro_client.py`/`test_maestro_client.py`. | `ls`/`grep` every file the issue names; reconcile counts against disk before planning. |
| 2 | Cited "ADR-015" for the migration rationale, copying it from the issue and Keystone's CLAUDE.md. | `ls docs/adr/` showed only 001–008; ADR-015 does not exist. | Verify each cited ADR/doc exists; pick the next real sequential number and reference a real ADR. |
| 3 | Planned a whole-directory `git mv tests/ ...` to move the test suite. | `tests/{unit,integration,...}/` held C++ GoogleTest `.cpp`/`.hpp` that must stay; only top-level `tests/*.py` migrate. | Classify by file content, not directory name; scope moves and greps to verified `.py` files. |
| 4 | Assumed cross-repo `git mv` (Keystone→Agamemnon) would preserve `git log --follow` history. | `git mv` preserves `--follow` only within one repo; submodules are independent repos, so a copy-in commit breaks the chain. | Flag cross-repo history as not preserved by plain `git mv`; true preservation needs `git filter-repo`/subtree. |
| 5 | Assumed ProjectAgamemnon already hosts Python, so the move was "just add the package". | Agamemnon had zero Python: no `pyproject.toml`, no `[pypi-dependencies]`, `src/` all `.cpp`. | Verify the destination's language/build/packaging before assuming a simple edit; this was a from-scratch bootstrap. |
| 6 | (ADR-016) Removed the migrated source dirs (`skills/`, `plugins/`, validators) and considered the migration done. | `main` went RED — consumers still referenced the moved surface: validators importing deleted modules, tests importing deleted validators, pre-commit hooks invoking deleted scripts, a workflow scanning the deleted plugin surface, entry points pointing at deleted modules, docs counting the old surface. | A migration isn't done when the SOURCE moves; it's done when every CONSUMER is reconciled. Sweep modules, tests, entry points, hooks, workflows, docs, allowlists, and whole test dirs. |
| 7 | Grepped only for the deleted module identifiers to find the fallout. | Missed the frozen COUNT/membership assertions: the console-script count a test freezes (53→51) and `SANCTIONED_EXTRA_TEST_DIRS` still listing `"plugins"` (which then tripped a separate phantom-test-dir guard). | Guards that assert a NUMBER or a SET, not a name, silently encode the old surface. Search for count/membership assertions explicitly, not just module names. |
| 8 | Ran tests only on the edited files to confirm the removal. | Tree-wide guards (whole-tree `mypy`, structure tests, phantom-dir guard) failed elsewhere — the break was far from the deletion. | Run the FULL suite locally after a migration; tree-wide guards fail far from the change, so a changed-files-only run reports false-green. |
| 9 | Treated the aggregate alert count as sufficient evidence. | A total can still hide a missing expected path, an unexpected extra path, or a scanner rooted at a third location. | Fail closed on the exact `(rule, path)` inventory; model duplicated payloads as `names × historical roots`. |
| 10 | Proposed proving source-repository cleanup by inspecting or modifying the destination marketplace. | Destination metadata does not determine which paths a scanner analyzed in the source repository. | Keep remediation and scanner execution in the source repo; use external marketplace config only as a runtime-topology assertion. |
| 11 | Considered manually dismissing alerts once their historical paths disappeared. | Path absence does not prove which ref, category, or configured root produced the hosted result. | Require a fresh authoritative default-branch scan; investigate surviving alerts and never dismiss them without verified provenance. |

## Results & Parameters

### Issue-said-X vs disk-had-Y reconciliation

| Claim in issue #143 | On-disk reality |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `src/keystone/maestro_client.py` to move | Does not exist (`ls` → "No such file or directory") |
| `tests/test_maestro_client.py` to move | Does not exist |
| "10 modules" | 10 `.py` source files, but `__main__.py` omitted and `maestro_client.py` invented |
| "12 tests" | 11 test files; `test_daemon.py` present but unlisted, `test_maestro_client.py` listed but absent |
| `grep -rln 'maestro\|Maestro'` | No matches in `src/`/`tests/` `.py` files |
| Cites ADR-015 (issue + Keystone CLAUDE.md) | `docs/adr/` has only 001–008; next real number is 009; reference ADR-006 |
| Destination ProjectAgamemnon hosts the package | Zero Python: no `pyproject.toml`, no `[pypi-dependencies]` in `pixi.toml`, `src/` all `.cpp` |

### Grep-guard commands (frozen public contract)

```bash
# NATS subject literal must survive byte-for-byte after the move/rename
grep -rn '"hi.tasks.>"' <dest>/src
grep -rn 'hi.tasks.{team_id}.{task_id}.{event}' <dest>/src
# _parse_subject dot-count arithmetic unchanged: hi.tasks.team.task.event == 5 parts
grep -n '_parse_subject' <dest>/src/**/*.py
```

### Acceptance-criterion scoping

```bash
# Only verified top-level Python migrates; exclude same-named C++ test dirs + build artifacts
find <src>/src <src>/tests -name '*.py' \
  -not -path '*/build*/*' -not -path '*/.worktrees/*'
# Confirm the absence the issue got wrong, as a guard
grep -rln 'maestro\|Maestro' <src>/src <src>/tests --include='*.py'   # expect: no output
```

### Post-move orphan-consumer sweep (ADR-016 / PR #2070) — the checklist that turned main green

| Consumer class | What was orphaned | Action taken |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Modules | `hephaestus/validation/{skill_catalog,repo_analyze_skills,skill_merge_method}.py` imported/validated the moved surface | Removed all 3 |
| Test files (orphaned) | 5 test files imported the removed validators | Removed all 5 |
| Test files (reconciled) | `test_validation_shim_parity.py`, `test_validation_parser_usage.py`, `test_validation_parser.py`, `test_validation_cli_contracts.py` imported the deleted `skill_catalog` symbol | Dropped that import + its one test each (kept the file) |
| Entry points | 2 console-script entries in `pyproject.toml` pointed at deleted modules | Removed both; updated the frozen count assertion **53 → 51** |
| Pre-commit hooks | 3 hooks invoked deleted scripts | Removed all 3 |
| CI workflow | `.github/workflows/hol-plugin-scanner.yml` scanned the deleted plugin surface | Removed workflow + `.plugin-scanner.toml` config + workflow-README row |
| Docs | `COMPATIBILITY.md` rows referenced removed surface | Removed the rows |
| Test-infra allowlist | `SANCTIONED_EXTRA_TEST_DIRS` still listed `"plugins"`; a phantom-test-dir guard then failed | Removed the `"plugins"` entry |
| Whole test dir | `tests/unit/plugins/` | Removed the directory |

### ProjectHephaestus #2255 proposed alert inventory

The issue's historical inventory is intentionally exact. The 46 license
findings are the Cartesian product of these 23 skill names and two retired
roots:

```text
skill-advisor
advise
learn
myrmidon-swarm
brainstorm
test-driven-development
systematic-debugging
verification
git-worktrees
finish-branch
code-review
repo-analyze
repo-analyze-quick
repo-analyze-strict
repo-analyze-full
repo-analyze-quick-full
repo-analyze-strict-full
review-pr-strict
worktree-cleanup
tidy
create-reusable-utilities
github-actions-python-cicd
python-repo-modernization
```

```text
skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
plugins/hephaestus/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
```

Each of four interface rules is expected exactly twice, once at each retired
manifest:

```text
.codex-plugin/plugin.json
plugins/hephaestus/.codex-plugin/plugin.json
```

The remaining singleton rules map one-to-one to:

```text
plugins/hephaestus/SECURITY.md
plugins/hephaestus/README.md
plugins/hephaestus/LICENSE
plugins/hephaestus/.codexignore
```

The nine-rule acceptance set is:

```text
