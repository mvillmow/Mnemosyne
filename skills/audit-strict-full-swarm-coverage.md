# Audit: Strict Full-Coverage Swarm Methodology

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-05-07 |
| **Objective** | Run a strict, evidence-based full-coverage repository audit by bucketing files per audit section and dispatching one swarm agent per section in waves of 5. |
| **Outcome** | Successful on ProjectScylla (1821 files, 168 src .py): overall B- (82%), CONDITIONAL GO, 3 critical / 19 major / 3 grouped minor findings filed as issues #1934-#1959. |
| **Verification** | verified-local |

## When to Use

- A repo audit where bug-finding completeness matters (sampling-based audits would miss bugs)
- Repos > 500 files where a single agent would overflow context
- Pre-release / pre-merge readiness reviews where every file must be inspected
- Strict grading is required: default F, A reserved for 0 critical + 0 major + ≤2 minor
- You are running `/hephaestus:repo-analyze-strict-full`, `/hephaestus:repo-analyze-full`, or equivalent

## When NOT to Use

- Quick health checks (use `/hephaestus:repo-analyze-quick` instead — defaults to B, sampling OK)
- Single-section spot audits (use a single agent directly)
- Repos < ~200 files where a single agent can read everything in one pass

## Verified Workflow

### Step 1 — Inventory every file

```bash
find . -type f \
  -not -path '*/\.*' \
  -not -path '*/node_modules/*' \
  -not -path '*/.venv/*' \
  -not -path '*/build/*' \
  -not -path '*/.pixi/*' \
  -not -path '*/__pycache__/*' \
  -not -path '*/htmlcov/*' \
  | sort > /tmp/repo-files.txt
wc -l /tmp/repo-files.txt
```

The file list is the source of truth — every entry must end up in exactly one section bucket.

### Step 2 — Bucket files by audit section

Partition `/tmp/repo-files.txt` into 15 section buckets:

1. Project structure & layout
2. Documentation (README, docs/, CHANGELOG)
3. Architecture & design
4. Source code quality
5. Testing
6. CI/CD & build
7. Dependencies & lockfiles
8. Security
9. Safety / runtime guarantees
10. Planning & issue tracking
11. AI tooling & agent configs (.claude/, agents/, skills/)
12. Packaging & distribution
13. Developer experience (justfile, tooling scripts)
14. API design (CLI, public Python API)
15. Compliance & licensing

Bucketing rules:
- Every file appears in exactly one bucket. Some files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`) span concerns — assign to the dominant one (packaging) and let other sections cross-reference.
- Save bucket lists as `/tmp/audit-section-NN.txt` so each agent gets a precise, finite worklist.

### Step 3 — Dispatch in waves of 5

Swarm runtime caps at 5 concurrent agents. Use 3 waves:

- Wave 1: sections 1–5
- Wave 2: sections 6–10
- Wave 3: sections 11–15

Launch each wave by issuing 5 Agent tool calls in a **single assistant message** with `run_in_background=true`. Wait for all 5 to complete before launching the next wave (avoid overlap so context budgets stay clean).

### Step 4 — Per-agent prompt template

Every dispatched agent receives all of:

1. **Section criteria verbatim** — copy the rubric for that section from the parent skill (`/hephaestus:repo-analyze-strict-full`).
2. **Strict grading rubric:**
   - Default grade is **F**.
   - **A** requires 0 critical + 0 major + ≤2 minor findings.
   - **B** requires 0 critical + ≤1 major.
   - "Exists" is not enough — the artifact must be correct, complete, and maintained.
   - Missing required items are **MAJOR** or **CRITICAL**, never nitpicks.
   - Anti-inflation: do not round up. A B+ stays B+, never becomes A-.
3. **Development principles list:** KISS, YAGNI, SOLID, DRY, POLA, TDD, MODULARITY — agent must flag violations.
4. **Bucketed file list:** path to `/tmp/audit-section-NN.txt`. Agent MUST read every file (no sampling).
5. **Report format:**
   - Grade + percentage
   - Evidence (file:line citations for every claim)
   - Strengths (verified, not aspirational)
   - Findings, each tagged severity (critical / major / minor) with `file:line`
   - Missing items (with severity)
   - Principle violations (with file:line)

### Step 5 — Final assembly (the L0 orchestrator's job)

Compute weighted overall grade:

| Section | Weight |
| ------- | ------ |
| Architecture | 15% |
| Source Quality | 15% |
| Testing | 12% |
| Security | 12% |
| Safety | 10% |
| CI/CD | 8% |
| Documentation | 7% |
| AI Tooling | 5% |
| Other 7 sections | 16% total (≈2.3% each) |

Sum to 100%.

### Step 6 — GO / NO-GO decision

| Verdict | Criteria |
| ------- | -------- |
| **GO** | 0 critical findings AND ≤2 major AND overall ≥80% |
| **CONDITIONAL GO** | ≤2 critical (each with a clear, scoped fix path) AND overall ≥65% |
| **NO-GO** | otherwise |

Always file critical and major findings as GitHub issues before merging the audit report.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Single-agent full audit | One agent reads every file in the repo | Context overflow on >500-file repos; quality drops sharply | Per-section swarm with bucketing keeps each agent's context tight |
| Sampling-based strict audit | Default `repo-analyze-strict` (10 random + 5 largest + 5 smallest per section) | Misses bugs in unsampled files; cannot honestly claim full coverage | Use the FULL variant when bug-finding completeness matters |
| Launching all 15 agents at once | Single message with 15 Agent tool calls | Swarm runtime caps at 5 concurrent — extras queue or fail | 3 sequential waves of 5 |
| Letting agents pick their own files | No bucketed list; agents discover files via `find` | Overlap (same file audited twice) and gaps (files audited zero times) | Pre-bucket every file into exactly one section list |

## Results & Parameters

Audit run on ProjectScylla 2026-05-07:

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Total files inventoried | 1821 |
| `src/scylla/` Python files | 168 |
| Audit sections | 15 |
| Concurrent agents per wave | 5 |
| Total waves | 3 |
| Critical findings | 3 |
| Major findings | 19 |
| Minor findings (grouped) | 3 |
| Overall weighted grade | B- (82%) |
| Verdict | CONDITIONAL GO |
| Issues filed | #1934-#1959 |

Tunable parameters when applying this skill to other repos:

- **Wave size**: 5 (limited by swarm runtime; do not increase)
- **Section count**: 15 default; add or merge to fit the repo's risk profile
- **Weights**: rebalance per project (e.g., research-only repos can drop CI/CD to 3% and raise Documentation to 15%)
- **GO threshold**: 80% default; raise to 90% for production gates

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Inventory
find . -type f \
  -not -path '*/\.*' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.venv/*' \
  -not -path '*/build/*' -not -path '*/.pixi/*' -not -path '*/__pycache__/*' \
  -not -path '*/htmlcov/*' \
  | sort > /tmp/repo-files.txt
wc -l /tmp/repo-files.txt

# 2. Bucket into /tmp/audit-section-01.txt ... /tmp/audit-section-15.txt
#    (every file in exactly one bucket)

# 3. Dispatch wave 1: 5 Agent tool calls in ONE message, run_in_background=true
#    Each agent gets: section rubric + strict grading + principles + bucket file + report format

# 4. Wait for wave 1 → dispatch wave 2 (sections 6-10) → wait → wave 3 (sections 11-15)

# 5. Assemble: weighted overall grade, GO/NO-GO, consolidated findings list

# 6. File critical/major findings as GitHub issues before publishing the audit
```
