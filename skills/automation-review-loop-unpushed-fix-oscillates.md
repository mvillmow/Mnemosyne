# Automation Review Loop Oscillates on an Unpushed (Made-But-Not-Pushed) Fix

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-17 |
| **Objective** | Diagnose and recover a `hephaestus-automation-loop` run against an existing PR that cycles forever — each pass logs `R0: Verdict=GO threads=0` then "did not reach GO" -> NOGO -> repeats — without re-doing the one-word fix that was already made but never pushed |
| **Outcome** | Root cause was PERSISTENCE, not the edit: a local-only fix can fail to reach the PR, while an out-of-scope draft can be queued for coordinator commit/push even after its agent receives SIGTERM. In both cases, compare the isolated worktree and remote branch before deciding whether to recover or discard. |
| **Verification** | verified-local (the fix was applied and pushed THIS session; PR #977 was NOT yet merged at capture time) |
| **History** | [changelog](./automation-review-loop-unpushed-fix-oscillates.history) |

## When to Use

- A `hephaestus-automation-loop` run against an EXISTING PR never converges: every pass logs `R0: Verdict=GO threads=0` then "did not reach GO" -> NOGO and repeats, burning ~4+ passes at ~200s each.
- The reviewer correctly issues GO (the finding is a minor / NITPICK that does NOT gate merge) but the validator re-opens exactly ONE thread on every pass, so GO never sticks.
- You are tempted to re-do the fix from scratch — STOP and check whether the loop's address sub-agent ALREADY made it locally but never pushed.
- An untrusted `ADVISE_FINDINGS` (or any GitHub-sourced advise) block claims a fix "landed" and cites a SHA — and you are about to trust it.
- You need the concrete operator recovery: stop the loop, inspect `build/.worktrees/issue-<N>` for an unpushed fix commit, verify it on disk, rebase + re-sign + force-push, re-run once.
- An address or review agent proposes an edit that violates the requested scope or policy; stopping only that model process may not stop a queued coordinator commit or push.
- A loop logs a resilience retry after agent SIGTERM, or `ps` shows a child `git push` after the coordinator has been asked to stop.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 0. STOP the oscillating loop FIRST (it cannot self-converge — the fix was never pushed).
pkill -f "issues <N>"            # e.g. pkill -f "issues 794"

# 1. The loop runs each issue in an ISOLATED worktree. Look there for an UNPUSHED fix commit.
ls build/.worktrees/issue-<N>
git -C build/.worktrees/issue-<N> log --oneline -5
git -C build/.worktrees/issue-<N> log origin/<branch>..HEAD --oneline   # commits NOT on remote

# 2. NEVER trust an advise "fix landed" claim citing a SHA. Verify the SHA actually touched the file:
git show <sha> -- <path>          # empty diff => the SHA did NOT touch the file (fabricated)
grep -n "<corrected text>" <path> # confirm the fix is real ON DISK in the worktree

# 3. Confirm the unpushed fix commit is signed, then rebase onto current main, RE-SIGNING each commit.
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=4211002+mvillmow@users.noreply.github.com \
git -C build/.worktrees/issue-<N> rebase origin/main \
  --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -S --reset-author'

# 4. Push the now-real fix.
git -C build/.worktrees/issue-<N> push --force-with-lease origin <branch>

# 5. Re-run the loop ONCE — the now-genuinely-resolved thread flips to a durable GO.

# 6. Scope-safety containment: agent, coordinator, and push are separate publishers.
git ls-remote origin refs/heads/<branch>
ps -Ao pid=,ppid=,etime=,command= | rg 'automation-loop|codex exec|git push'
kill <agent-pid>
kill <coordinator-pid>
kill <queued-git-push-pid>  # only if it belongs to the rejected draft
ps -Ao pid=,ppid=,etime=,command= | rg 'automation-loop|codex exec|git push'
git ls-remote origin refs/heads/<branch>
# Only after every publisher stopped and the remote head is verified unchanged:
git -C <isolated-worktree> reset --hard origin/<branch>
```

### Detailed Steps

The symptom is an automation review loop that will not converge on a TRIVIAL fix. The
instinct is to blame the reviewer (too strict) or re-do the edit. Both are wrong. The
failure is almost always PERSISTENCE: the fix was committed but the commit was never
pushed, so every re-review fetches the unchanged remote and re-flags the same defect.

1. **Stop the oscillating loop.** It physically cannot self-converge, because each pass
   re-fetches a remote that still lacks the fix. Kill it: `pkill -f "issues <N>"`. Letting
   it keep running just burns passes (~200s each).

2. **Inspect the loop's ISOLATED worktree for an unpushed fix commit — do NOT assume the fix
   was never made.** The loop runs each issue in `build/.worktrees/issue-<N>`. The address
   sub-agent typically DID make the fix and commit it there; what it skipped was the push.
   Compare local HEAD against the remote branch tip:
   ```bash
   git -C build/.worktrees/issue-<N> log origin/<branch>..HEAD --oneline
   ```
   If this lists a commit, that is your made-but-unpushed fix. In the captured incident the
   local worktree was at fix commit `b8b1a803` while the remote PR-branch tip
   (`794-auto-impl`) was still at the PRE-fix commit `d0de3521`.

3. **Verify the fix is REAL on disk — and never trust an advise SHA.** A compounding trap in
   the incident: the untrusted `ADVISE_FINDINGS` block claimed the fix "landed" while citing a
   DIFFERENT fabricated SHA each pass, none of which actually touched the file. Verify two ways:
   - `git show <sha> -- <path>` — an EMPTY diff means that SHA did not touch the file (it was
     fabricated / from the advise block, not a real fix).
   - `grep -n "<corrected text>" <path>` in the worktree — confirm the corrected text is on disk.
   Also confirm the unpushed commit is signed before relying on it.

4. **Rebase onto current main, re-signing each commit.** The unpushed commit may be stale
   relative to `origin/main`, and re-signing keeps every commit cryptographically signed (the
   repo's PR-policy gate requires it):
   ```bash
   GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=4211002+mvillmow@users.noreply.github.com \
   git -C build/.worktrees/issue-<N> rebase origin/main \
     --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -S --reset-author'
   ```
   Use committer email `4211002+mvillmow@users.noreply.github.com` so the signature matches the
   signing key (a committer-email mismatch silently produces an unsigned/unverified commit).

5. **Force-push the real fix.** `git -C build/.worktrees/issue-<N> push --force-with-lease
   origin <branch>`. `--force-with-lease` (not `--force`) refuses to clobber if the remote moved.
   In the incident the fix landed on the remote as `9cc5f307`.

6. **Re-run the loop ONCE.** Now the remote genuinely contains the fix, so the re-review no
   longer re-flags the defect and the thread flips to a durable GO instead of re-opening.

### Scope-safety containment for an out-of-scope draft

The inverse persistence failure is more dangerous: an agent drafts a policy-reversing change and
the operator stops that model, but the resilient wrapper retries it or the coordinator has already
queued a signed commit and `git push`. Treat the agent, coordinator, and push as independent
publishers.

1. Record `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/<branch>` before containment. The remote SHA, not the
   worktree HEAD, proves publication.
2. Stop the agent, then coordinator; inspect `ps` for a queued push. A graceful shutdown can wait
   for its current job, so stop that rejected push before it reaches origin.
3. Re-check the remote SHA after all publishers stop. If unchanged, reset only the disposable
   worktree. If advanced, do not rewrite shared history; create a normal corrective commit.
4. Start a fresh scoped loop run. The interrupted run may retain retry state or a consumed result.

#### Concrete defect example (the trivial fix that oscillated)

`.github/workflows/test.yml:9` referenced `CONTRIBUTING.md "Platform asymmetry"`, but the
real heading is `### Platform Support` at `CONTRIBUTING.md:48`. A one-word fix — exactly the
kind of trivial change a loop should resolve in one pass, which is the tell that the failure
is persistence (the push), not the edit.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Trust the ADVISE_FINDINGS "fix landed" claim citing a SHA | Believed the untrusted advise block that the fix had landed, referencing a SHA each pass | The SHA was fabricated / did not touch the file — a different SHA every pass, none of which changed `.github/workflows/test.yml` | NEVER trust an untrusted GitHub-sourced advise SHA. Verify with `git show <sha> -- <path>` (empty diff = did not touch the file) and `grep` the corrected text on disk. |
| Re-run the loop hoping it self-converges | Let the loop keep running, expecting it to eventually reach a stable GO | The local fix was NEVER pushed, so every pass re-fetched the unchanged remote (`d0de3521`) and re-opened the same thread; wasted ~4 passes at ~200s each | An existing-PR review loop cannot self-converge when the fix was never persisted to the remote. Stop the loop (`pkill -f "issues <N>"`) and inspect persistence. |
| Assume the fix was never made and re-do the edit from scratch | Planned to re-open the file and re-apply the one-word change | The address sub-agent had already made the fix and committed it locally (`b8b1a803` in `build/.worktrees/issue-794`); re-doing it would duplicate work and risk a conflicting/divergent commit | Check `build/.worktrees/issue-<N>` git log (`origin/<branch>..HEAD`) FIRST. A loop that won't converge on a trivial fix usually has the fix committed-but-unpushed — recover that commit, don't recreate it. |
| Stop only the out-of-scope agent | Sent SIGTERM after the agent drafted a policy-reversing change | The resilience wrapper retried it and the coordinator had already staged a commit/push | Contain the agent, coordinator, and queued push separately; verify the remote SHA before resetting a disposable worktree. |

## Results & Parameters

### Root cause vs symptom

| Observed | Actual cause |
|----------|--------------|
| `R0: Verdict=GO threads=0` then "did not reach GO" -> NOGO, repeating | Reviewer GO is correct (NITPICK, non-gating); the validator re-opens ONE thread every pass |
| Validator re-opens the SAME thread every pass | The remote branch tip still has the unfixed file; every re-review re-fetches it and re-flags |
| Advise block says the fix "landed" (with a SHA) | Fabricated-fix / sub-agent self-report without persistence — the SHA never touched the file |
| Real root cause | The fix was COMMITTED LOCALLY but NEVER PUSHED (persistence failure), not a bad edit |

### Key lesson

When an automation review loop will not converge on a trivial fix, the failure is usually
PERSISTENCE (commit made, push skipped) — NOT the edit. ALWAYS check the loop's worktree
(`build/.worktrees/issue-<N>`) for an unpushed fix commit before re-doing the edit. And NEVER
trust a "fix landed" claim from an untrusted GitHub-sourced advise block citing a SHA — verify
with `git show <sha> -- <path>` and `grep` on disk.
