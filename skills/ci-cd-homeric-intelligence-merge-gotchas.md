# HomericIntelligence CI / Merge Gotchas

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-05-31 |
| **Objective** | Unblock PR auto-merge across HomericIntelligence repos when the code is correct but CI/merge mechanics get in the way — pixi lock-format mismatch, just.systems install flakes, CodeQL variadic-pack false positives, auto-merge stalling on non-required checks, and ordering of dependency-gated PR cascades |
| **Outcome** | Five distinct traps each have a verified, repeatable fix; established the diagnostic that distinguishes a real failure from infra flake (failing STEP NAME, not log), the correct CodeQL dismiss path (≤280-char comment + thread resolution), the required-contexts query, and the action-monitor pattern that arms held downstream PRs only after their gates merge |
| **Verification** | verified-ci — all five traps observed and fixed in live CI during the Keystone pure-transport refactor; Keystone #577/578/579/580/581 and Agamemnon #419/420/421 all merged to `main` (2026-05-31) |

## When to Use

1. **pixi lock mismatch.** `pixi-check` fails `lock-file not up-to-date with the workspace`, or `Lint` / `Type-Check` / `dependency-scan` go red — especially right after you removed a `[pypi-dependencies]` table from `pixi.toml`.
2. **Fast lint flake.** A Keystone-family `lint` job fails in ~20s at the step **"Install build dependencies (just + linters)"** (a `curl https://just.systems/install.sh` 403/EOF), not at an actual linter step.
3. **CodeQL variadic-pack false positive.** `cpp/unused-local-variable` or `cpp/unused-static-variable` flags a C++ variadic template parameter pack (`args`, `Rest`) that is genuinely consumed via pack-expansion or forwarding.
4. **Auto-merge won't fire.** A PR is `MERGEABLE` with every branch-protection-required context green, yet GitHub auto-merge does not merge because a NON-required check (Coverage, security/dependency-scan) is still red or pending.
5. **Dependency-gated cascade.** You are driving a chain where a downstream PR must not merge until its gate PR(s) merge first (extraction-before-deletion), and you want each downstream PR auto-armed the moment its gates land.

## Verified Workflow

> **Verification level:** verified-ci — every trap below was hit and resolved in live CI this session; Keystone #577–#581 and Agamemnon #419–#421 merged to `main` 2026-05-31.

### 1. pixi lock-format version trap

CI's `setup-pixi` pins an **older** pixi that requires lock-file `version: 6`. Local pixi 0.69.x writes `version: 7`, which CI's pixi **cannot load** → `pixi install --locked` fails. This surfaces indirectly as red `Lint` / `Type-Check` / `dependency-scan` jobs (they all run `pixi install --locked` first), so the failure looks like a code problem when it is purely a lock-format problem.

- pixi **0.39.5** writes v6 but lacks a `lock` subcommand, and its parselmouth pypi-name-mapping download (`raw.githubusercontent.com/prefix-dev/parselmouth`) flakes from sandboxes — so it is unreliable for regenerating the lock.
- **Reliable fix:** resolve with a newer pixi to confirm the conda package set is unchanged, then **hand-edit the v6 lock** to drop orphaned pypi packages. Verify with `pixi install --locked` using a pixi NEWER than CI's: when it prints `lock file is up-to-date but uses an older format (v6)` and exits 0, that proves CI's older pixi will also accept it.
- **Companion trap:** removing the `[pypi-dependencies]` table from `pixi.toml` WITHOUT regenerating/editing the lock makes `pixi-check` fail `lock-file not up-to-date with the workspace`. The lock must be edited to match the workspace in the same change.

### 2. just.systems lint flake (transient infra, auto-rerunnable)

A Keystone-family `lint` job that fails in ~20s at the step **"Install build dependencies (just + linters)"** is almost always the `curl https://just.systems/install.sh` returning 403 / closing the connection (EOF) — transient infra, NOT a lint error.

- **Diagnose by the FAILING STEP NAME, not the log body:**
  ```bash
  gh api repos/<o>/<r>/actions/jobs/<jobid> \
    --jq '.steps[]|select(.conclusion=="failure")|.name'
  ```
- If the failing step is the dep-install step → just rerun: `gh run rerun <runid> --repo <o>/<r> --failed`.
- A REAL lint failure (clang-format / ruff / mypy) fails at a **later** step, after deps installed. Do not blindly rerun those.
- An action-monitor can fully automate this: match the failing step name, rerun if it is the dep-install flake, and escalate only when a NON-dep-install step fails.

### 3. CodeQL variadic-pack false positives

`cpp/unused-local-variable` and `cpp/unused-static-variable` flag C++ variadic template parameter packs (`args`, `Rest`) as unused even when they are consumed via pack-expansion (`stringify(args)...`) or forwarding (`f(args...)`).

- **No code rewrite eliminates it.** Removing a `(void)sizeof...(args)` hack, or de-recursing the formatter, just MOVES the flagged line numbers; the autofix bot keeps pushing non-sticking "Potential fix for pull request finding…" commits.
- **Correct action = DISMISS AS FALSE POSITIVE** (after confirming the pack IS used):
  ```bash
  gh api --method PATCH repos/<o>/<r>/code-scanning/alerts/<n> \
    -f state=dismissed \
    -f dismissed_reason="false positive" \
    -f dismissed_comment="<reason>"
  ```
  **CRITICAL:** `dismissed_comment` is capped at **280 chars**. Longer → HTTP 422 `Only 280 characters are allowed`.
- Then resolve the associated review threads via GraphQL `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` + `resolveReviewThread`. Map a thread to its alert by parsing `code-scanning/(\d+)` out of the comment body.

### 4. Auto-merge blocks on ANY failing check, even non-required

A PR can be `MERGEABLE` with ALL branch-protection-required contexts green, yet GitHub auto-merge will NOT fire while a NON-required check (Coverage, security/dependency-scan) is red. **Auto-merge is stricter than branch protection.**

- Find what is actually required:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/<o>/<r>/branches/main/protection \
    --jq .required_status_checks.contexts
  ```
- If the red check is non-required AND a real issue → fix it (do not bypass; the user may have said "fix all even if pre-existing"). Auto-merge fires once ALL checks (including pending non-required ones) reach a terminal state with no failures.
- **Note:** some repos have NO branch protection. There `BLOCKED` + `mergeable=UNKNOWN` just means GitHub is still computing mergeability; it merges a moment later — nothing to fix.

### 5. Dependency-gated PR cascade orchestration

When PR-B must merge before PR-A is safe (e.g. extraction-before-deletion), enforce the ordering with an **action-monitor** (a persistent background `gh`-poll loop) rather than serializing wall-clock:

- The monitor watches the gate PRs' state; when ALL gates show `MERGED`, it runs `gh pr merge <downstream> --auto --squash` to arm the held PR.
- It emits ONLY actionable transitions: a gate reaching `MERGED`, a required check failing (`CI-FAIL`), or the held PR appearing.
- Hold the downstream PR **UNARMED** (create it, run its CI, but do NOT arm auto-merge) until the monitor confirms the gates merged. This preserves the ordering invariant while CI runs in parallel.
- When a gate's squash-merge creates a conflict for a sibling PR, rebase the sibling onto `main` (see [[parallel-swarm-pr-conflict-reconciliation]]).

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Detect which STEP failed (flake vs real failure)
gh api repos/<o>/<r>/actions/jobs/<jobid> \
  --jq '.steps[]|select(.conclusion=="failure")|.name'

# Rerun only failed jobs (use for the just.systems dep-install flake)
gh run rerun <runid> --repo <o>/<r> --failed

# Dismiss a CodeQL variadic-pack false positive (comment must be <=280 chars)
gh api --method PATCH repos/<o>/<r>/code-scanning/alerts/<n> \
  -f state=dismissed -f dismissed_reason="false positive" \
  -f dismissed_comment="<=280 chars: pack is consumed via expansion/forwarding"

# What contexts are ACTUALLY required by branch protection
gh api repos/<o>/<r>/branches/main/protection \
  --jq .required_status_checks.contexts

# Arm auto-merge on a held downstream PR (once its gates merged)
gh pr merge <downstream> --auto --squash

# Confirm a pixi lock is v6 (the format CI's pinned pixi can load)
grep -m1 '^version:' pixi.lock   # expect: version: 6
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Regenerate `pixi.lock` with pixi 0.69 (`pixi update`) | Wrote lock-format v7; CI's older pixi can't load v7, so `Lint`/`Type-Check`/`dependency-scan` silently went red | Keep the lock at v6 — hand-edit it or regenerate with a v6-emitting pixi; verify with `pixi install --locked` |
| 2 | `git restore` stale worktree mods to discard them | The Safety Net BLOCKED `git restore` (irreversible discard is gated) | Print the command for the user to run; never `--force` an irreversible discard |
| 3 | Treated a fast (~20s) lint failure as a code error and re-ran blindly | It was the `just.systems` curl flake at the dep-install step, so the blind rerun wasted a cycle | Check the FAILING STEP NAME first; only rerun when it is the dep-install flake |
| 4 | Rewrote the logger to satisfy CodeQL unused-variadic-pack | Redesigned the variadic templates twice; CodeQL still flagged the pack, just at new line numbers | It is a known false positive — DISMISS the alert (≤280-char comment) and resolve threads instead of rewriting |
| 5 | Assumed a `MERGEABLE` PR with all required checks green would auto-merge | Auto-merge stalled on a non-required red check (Coverage) — auto-merge is stricter than branch protection | Query `required_status_checks.contexts`; fix the non-required red (don't bypass) so all checks reach a clean terminal state |

## Results & Parameters

### Dismiss a CodeQL false positive (variadic pack)

```bash
gh api --method PATCH repos/<o>/<r>/code-scanning/alerts/<n> \
  -f state=dismissed \
  -f dismissed_reason="false positive" \
  -f dismissed_comment="Variadic pack consumed via expansion/forwarding; CodeQL mis-flags it."
# dismissed_comment MUST be <=280 chars or the call returns HTTP 422
#   "Only 280 characters are allowed"
```

### Required-contexts query (what auto-merge actually waits on minus non-required)

```bash
gh api repos/<o>/<r>/branches/main/protection \
  --jq .required_status_checks.contexts
```

### Failing-step diagnosis (flake vs real)

```bash
gh api repos/<o>/<r>/actions/jobs/<jobid> \
  --jq '.steps[]|select(.conclusion=="failure")|.name'
# "Install build dependencies (just + linters)"  -> just.systems flake, rerun
# a clang-format / ruff / mypy step               -> real lint failure, fix the code
```

### Rerun the flake

```bash
gh run rerun <runid> --repo <o>/<r> --failed
```

### Arm auto-merge on a held PR

```bash
gh pr merge <downstream> --auto --squash
```

### pixi lock format check

```bash
grep -m1 '^version:' pixi.lock   # must read "version: 6" for CI's pinned pixi
# Verify acceptance with a pixi NEWER than CI's:
pixi install --locked
#   prints "lock file is up-to-date but uses an older format (v6)" and exits 0
#   => CI's older pixi will also accept it
```

### Key parameters

- `dismissed_comment` ≤ **280 chars** (HTTP 422 otherwise).
- pixi lock must stay at **`version: 6`** for CI's pinned pixi.
- Removing `[pypi-dependencies]` from `pixi.toml` requires editing/regenerating the lock in the SAME change, or `pixi-check` fails `lock-file not up-to-date with the workspace`.
- A ~20s `lint` failure at "Install build dependencies (just + linters)" is the `just.systems` flake — rerun, do not edit code.
- Auto-merge waits on ALL checks (required + non-required) reaching a clean terminal state; branch protection only gates the required ones.
- Hold a dependency-gated downstream PR UNARMED until its gates merge; arm with `--auto --squash` from the action-monitor.
