# Verifying Merged PRs End-to-End ("merged ≠ verified")

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-19 |
| **Objective** | Establish that closing an umbrella issue tracking N sequential implementation PRs requires actually running the composed artifacts/pipeline — not assuming merged-green PRs compose into a working whole |
| **Outcome** | Successful — ProjectOdyssey issue #5413 ("Ship ProjectOdyssey as an installable Mojo package") had 4 implementation PRs already merged green, yet driving the 5 acceptance criteria end-to-end surfaced 12 sequential defects, each fixed in its own follow-up PR. Issue closed completed. |
| **Verification** | verified-ci — all 12 follow-up fix PRs landed with green CI; the release pipeline reached the `create-release` job for the first time |
| **History** | n/a (initial version) |

## When to Use

- An umbrella / tracking issue is still **OPEN** even though every child implementation PR has merged
- Acceptance criteria exist but no one has driven them **end-to-end** — only the individual PRs were reviewed
- A workflow is **tag-triggered** or **rarely run** (`release.yml`, weekly E2E, nightly) and has never actually fired with real inputs
- You catch yourself (or a teammate) reasoning "all N PRs merged and CI was green, so the feature works"
- You need to **budget effort** for closing such an issue — a verification pass is inherently iterative and multi-round-trip
- A feature was split across "PR 1 of N … PR N of N" — the composition was never tested, only the slices

## The Core Insight: Why Merged ≠ Verified

When a feature is split into N sequential PRs, three structural gaps remain after all N merge green:

1. **Per-PR CI tests only the changed files in isolation.** PR 1 (rename `shared/` → `src/projectodyssey/`)
   passed its CI; PR 2 (conda recipe) passed its CI; PR 3 (wheel) passed its CI; PR 4 (`release.yml`)
   passed its CI. **No CI run ever exercised the four together** as one pipeline. CI green on each slice
   says nothing about the composition.

2. **Defects are SEQUENTIAL — a cascade, not a set.** Each fix unblocks the next failure. You cannot
   observe defect N+1 until defect N is fixed, because defect N halts the pipeline before N+1's code
   path is reached. Example chain from ProjectOdyssey #5413:
   conda `mojo-version` pin wrong → (fix) → in-recipe test bug surfaces → (fix) → install-script bug
   surfaces → (fix) → … 12 defects deep. A verification pass is therefore **inherently iterative** —
   budget for many round-trips, not one.

3. **Tag-triggered / rarely-run jobs were never triggered.** A `release.yml` with stages
   `validate-version → build → test → create-release` only runs when a tag is pushed. If no tag was
   ever pushed, **every one of those jobs is unverified** regardless of how clean the YAML looks.

**Recommendation:** When an issue tracks "N sequential implementation PRs", treat *closing the issue*
as a distinct verification task with its own effort budget. Actually run the artifacts and the
pipeline. Do not assume merged PRs compose. Tag-triggered or rarely-run workflows especially need an
explicit smoke trigger before the issue can be honestly closed.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Enumerate the acceptance criteria from the umbrella issue — these are the verification targets
gh issue view <ISSUE> --json body --jq .body

# 2. Confirm child PRs merged (this is NOT verification — just context)
gh pr list --repo <OWNER>/<REPO> --state merged --search "<issue-keyword>"

# 3. Drive EACH acceptance criterion end-to-end with the real artifact/pipeline.
#    Expect a sequential defect cascade — fix N, re-run, observe N+1, repeat.

# 4. For tag-triggered / rarely-run workflows: force a real run.
#    Push a throwaway pre-release tag, or use workflow_dispatch if the workflow supports it:
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f version=0.0.0-verify   # if dispatch input exists
git tag v0.0.0-verify && git push origin v0.0.0-verify           # otherwise: throwaway tag
gh run watch <RUN_ID>
git push origin :v0.0.0-verify                                   # delete the throwaway tag after

# 5. Only close the umbrella issue once EVERY criterion is observed passing end-to-end.
gh issue close <ISSUE> --comment "All N acceptance criteria verified end-to-end. See PRs #..."
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Extract the acceptance criteria.** They are the verification contract. If the issue lists
   "5 acceptance criteria", you have 5 things to *observe* passing — not 4 PRs to confirm merged.

2. **Treat merged child PRs as context, not evidence.** A merged green PR proves its slice compiled
   and its own tests passed. It does not prove the slice composes with its siblings.

3. **Run the composed pipeline / artifact for real.**
   - Packaging: actually build the `.conda` / `.mojopkg` / `.whl`, install it into a clean env,
     import the package.
   - Release: actually push a tag (throwaway pre-release tag) and watch every job run.

4. **Expect and budget for a defect cascade.** Fix the first failure, re-run, observe the next.
   Each fix is its own small follow-up PR. Do not try to predict defect N+1 before defect N is
   fixed — you literally cannot reach that code path yet.

5. **Force tag-triggered / rarely-run workflows to fire.** Use `workflow_dispatch` if the workflow
   declares an input; otherwise push a throwaway pre-release tag and delete it afterward. A
   never-triggered job is an unverified job.

6. **File issues for defects you choose not to fix in-pass.** A genuinely out-of-scope or
   lower-priority defect (e.g. a too-strict version regex) gets its own tracked issue rather than
   blocking the verification pass.

7. **Close the umbrella issue only when every criterion is observed passing**, and reference the
   follow-up fix PRs in the closing comment for an audit trail.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Assume merged = done | Treated issue #5413 as effectively complete because its 4 implementation PRs (#5414–#5417) had all merged green | Each PR's CI exercised only its own changed files; the packaging pipeline (rename → recipe → wheel → release.yml) had never run as a composed whole. Driving the acceptance criteria surfaced 12 hidden defects. | Merged-and-green PRs do not compose. Closing an umbrella issue is a separate verification task — actually run the composed artifact/pipeline. |
| Try to predict the full defect list up front | After hitting the conda `mojo-version` pin bug, attempted to enumerate all remaining packaging defects in one analysis pass | Defects are sequential — each fix unblocks the next failure. Defect N halts the pipeline before defect N+1's code path is even reached, so N+1 is unobservable until N is fixed. | A verification pass is inherently iterative. Budget for many fix→re-run round-trips instead of one big upfront analysis. |
| Trust `release.yml` because the YAML looked correct | Assumed the tag-triggered release pipeline (validate-version → build → test → create-release) worked because the workflow file passed lint and review | The workflow had never been triggered — no tag was ever pushed — so none of its jobs had ever executed with real inputs. Several bugs only surfaced on the first real run. | Tag-triggered / rarely-run workflows need an explicit smoke trigger (throwaway pre-release tag or `workflow_dispatch`). A never-run job is an unverified job. |

### Related defect: AVX-512 ISA mismatch surfaced during the same pass

While driving the pipeline, an ASan SIGILL flake hit 232/298 tests at once. Diagnosed (via the
`mojo-jit-crash-and-retry-strategies` skill, AVX-512 section) as the AVX-512 ISA mismatch pattern:
Mojo emitted AVX-512 on a runner whose hypervisor masks the AVX-512 CPUID leaves. **Concrete fix:
pin sanitizer builds to `--mcpu=x86-64-v3`** (Haswell microarchitecture level, pre-AVX-512) — every
GitHub-hosted runner supports the `x86-64-v3` level, so this is a safe floor. See
`mojo-jit-crash-and-retry-strategies` for the full AVX-512 diagnostic flow.

## Verified On
