# Resolve github-code-quality Bot Threads Without Code Changes

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-27 |
| **Objective** | Unblock PRs that pass all CI checks but show `MERGEABLE / BLOCKED` because of unresolved bot review threads on deliberate test-patch-seam imports |
| **Outcome** | Resolved 10 bot threads across two PRs with one explanatory comment per PR; both PRs flipped to `MERGEABLE / CLEAN` and merged via auto-merge |
| **Verification** | verified-ci (observed unblocking ProjectHephaestus PRs #604 and #606 on 2026-05-27) |

## When to Use

- `github-code-quality[bot]` (or similar static analyzer bot) posts a "Unused import" review comment on a deliberately-preserved import
- The import has an explicit `# noqa: F401` comment but the bot still flags it
- `gh pr view <N>` shows `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` even though `[.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion == "FAILURE")]` is empty
- Your repo's org-level branch protection (or rulesets) has `required_review_thread_resolution: true`

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. List all unresolved review threads with their IDs
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "ORG", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: <N>) {
      reviewThreads(first: 50) {
        nodes { id isResolved path line comments(first: 1) { nodes { author { login } } } }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false) | "\(.id) \(.path):\(.line) by \(.comments.nodes[0].author.login)"'

# 2. Post a single top-level explanatory comment
gh pr comment <N> --body-file /tmp/explanation.md

# 3. Resolve every thread you intend to dismiss
for TID in PRRT_AAA PRRT_BBB PRRT_CCC; do
  gh api graphql -f query='
    mutation Resolve($tid: ID!) {
      resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $tid}) {
        thread { id isResolved }
      }
    }' -f tid="$TID" --jq '.data.resolveReviewThread.thread'
done
```

### Detailed Steps

**Why the bot doesn't honor `# noqa: F401`.** The `github-code-quality[bot]` (and similar GitHub-Marketplace static analyzers) runs its own AST-based unused-import detection. It is NOT a wrapper around ruff/flake8/pyflakes, so it doesn't read those tools' suppression directives. The same is true for many CodeQL configurations: their queries don't honor `# noqa`.

**Why this matters.** GitHub branch protection / org rulesets can enforce `required_review_thread_resolution: true`. When enabled, ANY unresolved review thread (regardless of who wrote it or whether the review is `APPROVED` / `CHANGES_REQUESTED` / `COMMENTED`) blocks the merge. A bot leaving 7 unresolved threads on a PR means 7 blocks, even if every CI check is green and the bot's review state is merely `COMMENTED`.

**Why you should NOT just remove the imports.** Test-patch-seam re-exports preserve the existing test-mock surface after a refactor. Example: when extracting `BaseReviewer.__init__` from `PRReviewer` / `AddressReviewer`, the base class does:

```python
def _resolve_from_subclass_module(cls: type, name: str):
    module = importlib.import_module(cls.__module__)
    return getattr(module, name)
```

This means `BaseReviewer.__init__` reads `WorktreeManager` from `pr_reviewer`'s OWN namespace — so existing tests doing `patch("hephaestus.automation.pr_reviewer.WorktreeManager", ...)` still intercept. Removing the import per the bot's suggestion breaks `getattr(module, "WorktreeManager")` → `AttributeError`, breaking ~24 existing tests immediately.

**The correct resolution.** Resolve the threads with one explanatory PR comment that:
1. Names the design intent (test-patch seam) and where it's implemented (e.g. `_resolve_from_subclass_module`).
2. Names the alternative (removing imports) and why it breaks (`AttributeError` + test count).
3. Cites the `# noqa: F401` markers as documentation, not enforcement.
4. States that you're resolving all N threads as won't-fix.

Then use the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation for each thread. The REST `pulls/<N>/comments/<id>` endpoint's `resolved` field is READ-ONLY; the GraphQL mutation is the only way.

**Order of operations.**

1. Get thread IDs via the GraphQL query above. Each `id` looks like `PRRT_kwDOQww0as6E95j8` (base64-encoded).
2. Post the explanatory comment FIRST so reviewers see the rationale alongside the resolved threads.
3. Run the `resolveReviewThread` mutation for each ID.
4. `gh pr view <N> --json mergeStateStatus` should flip from `BLOCKED` → `UNKNOWN` → `CLEAN` over ~30s as GitHub re-computes mergeability.
5. If auto-merge was already armed (`gh pr merge --auto --squash`), it fires automatically once `CLEAN`.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Add `# noqa: F401` to silence the bot | Annotate the import line so ruff doesn't flag it | The bot isn't ruff. It runs its own AST analysis and ignores comment-based suppressions. | Don't conflate ruff's noqa with arbitrary bots. Each bot has its own rule engine. |
| Add `__all__ = [...]` listing the re-exports | Make the public API explicit so the bot sees the import as "used" | github-code-quality's "unused import" check tracks symbol usage WITHIN the module, not export visibility. `__all__` does not suppress it. | `__all__` documents intent for humans + `from x import *`, but doesn't change AST-level usage analysis. |
| Remove the imports as the bot suggests | Take the bot's "best fix" recommendation literally | Breaks 24+ tests that use `patch("hephaestus.automation.X.Y", ...)` where Y is the now-removed re-export. The `getattr(module, "Y")` in the BaseReviewer pattern raises `AttributeError`. | Bots that statically analyze don't know about runtime `getattr` lookups. Reject suggestions that break runtime behavior to satisfy static rules. |
| Reply to each bot comment individually with a regular `gh pr comment` | Hope GitHub auto-resolves threads on follow-up | A reply is just another comment in the thread. Threads only resolve via the explicit `resolveReviewThread` mutation. | Resolving a thread is a state mutation; commenting in a thread is not. |
| Force-push to dismiss the bot's review | Hope the bot reposts on the new SHA and the old threads get auto-resolved | Threads pinned to specific lines persist across force-pushes if the lines still exist. New review run posts NEW threads on top of the old unresolved ones. | Force-push doesn't resolve threads. It can multiply them. |

## Results & Parameters

**Specific numbers (ProjectHephaestus 2026-05-27):**

- PR #604: 7 inline comments from `github-code-quality[bot]`, 6 unresolved threads.
- PR #606: 8 inline comments (2 bot runs), 4 unresolved threads.
- Resolved with: 1 explanatory PR comment per PR + GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` × {6, 4} = ~10 GraphQL calls total.
- Time elapsed: ~3 minutes.
- After resolution, mergeStateStatus on #606: `BLOCKED` → `CLEAN` within 8 seconds. PR #604 took ~30s (GitHub recompute lag, not a real difference).

**Template for the explanatory PR comment:**

```markdown
The `github-code-quality` bot flagged N imports as "unused" in `<file_paths>`. All N findings
are intentional and I'm resolving them as won't-fix.

These imports are **deliberate test-patch seams** introduced by <refactor_name>. The base class /
runner / parent module resolves these symbols from the SUBCLASS's module at instantiation time
(see `<file>::<function_name>`), which preserves N+ existing test mocks of the form:

    patch("<module_path>.<SymbolName>", ...)

Removing the imports per the bot's suggestion would break those tests immediately, since
`getattr(module, "<SymbolName>")` would raise `AttributeError`. The `# noqa: F401` markers +
inline comments document this; the bot doesn't honor `noqa` directives.

Resolving all N unresolved bot threads on this PR.
```

**Detection one-liner — is your blocked PR a victim of unresolved bot threads?**

```bash
# Returns the list of unresolved review threads. If the only authors are bots and your CI is green,
# this skill applies.
gh pr view <N> --json mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,reviews --jq '{
  state: .mergeStateStatus,
  failingChecks: [.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion == "FAILURE") | .name],
  reviews: [.reviews[] | {state, author: .author.login}]
}'
```

If `state: BLOCKED` + `failingChecks: []` + all reviews are by bots → run the resolveReviewThread loop.
