# Dependency Manifest: Single Source of Truth

Keep Python dependency declarations consistent across `pixi.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, and
`requirements*.txt` so the published install contract always matches the tested environment.

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-12 |
| **Objective** | Eliminate dependency declaration drift (floors, upper-caps, duplicated version fields) across multiple manifests and enforce consistency with semantic-version-aware regression guards |
| **Outcome** | Successful — single source of truth per concern, drift-detection scripts/tests, and PEP 440 comparison that catches `9.0` vs `9.0.0` representation skew |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |

## When to Use

- Python dependencies are declared in multiple files (pixi.toml, pyproject.toml,
  requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt) with divergent version constraints
- Pinned versions in requirements*.txt fall outside pixi.toml range constraints
  (e.g., `pytest==8.4.2` vs `<8`)
- Aligning **floor** constraints across manifests for API-incompatible majors
  (e.g., PyGithub `>=1.55` vs `>=2.9.1`)
- Aligning **upper-cap** constraints across manifests for API-incompatible majors
  (e.g., mypy `<3` vs `<2`)
- Floors/caps that are semantically equal but differ in string form (`9.0` vs `9.0.0`)
- `pixi.toml [workspace]` has a `version` field that duplicates `pyproject.toml [project] version`
- Unbounded `[pypi-dependencies]` entries that need an explicit `<next-major>` upper bound
- An unbounded `python = ">=3.10"` in `pixi.toml [dependencies]` lets the dev/lint env
  resolve to an untested/experimental interpreter (e.g. Python 3.14 free-threaded
  `cp314t`) outside the classifier/CI support matrix — cap it at one minor above the
  highest classifier (`>=3.10,<3.14` for classifiers topping out at 3.13)
- Adding regression tests / CI guardrails to lock in manifest consistency going forward

> **See also:** [[state-machine-and-resource-lifecycle-patterns]] (free-threaded cp314t
> hangs `ProcessPoolExecutor`/`multiprocessing.Manager` proxies) and
> [[tooling-pixi-lockfile-churn-self-reference]] (lock-stability check after re-resolution).

## The Core Problem

When the same dependency is declared in more than one manifest, the **published install
contract** (what pip users get) can drift from the **tested environment** (what pixi
developers and CI run). For packages with API-incompatible major versions, this produces
silent runtime breakage.

**Broken setup (floor skew):**

- `pyproject.toml`: `PyGithub>=1.55,<3` (published contract permits 1.x)
- `pixi.toml`: `pygithub = ">=2.9.1,<3"` (dev/test only ever runs 2.x)
- Result: pip users install 1.x, code only works on 2.x → silent failure.

**Broken setup (upper-cap skew):**

- `pyproject.toml`: `mypy>=1.8.0,<3` (permits 2.x)
- `pixi.toml [feature.dev]`: `mypy = ">=1.8.0,<2"` (tested on 1.x only)
- Result: pip users get mypy 2.x with different error semantics → silent breakage.

**Correct setup:** every manifest declares the same floor *and* the same cap; a regression
guard fails CI if any pair drifts (even across `9.0`/`9.0.0` representation differences).

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Audit: find divergent declarations of a dependency across every manifest
grep -nE "PyGithub|pygithub" pyproject.toml pixi.toml
grep -nE "mypy"             pyproject.toml pixi.toml

# 2. Pick the source-of-truth constraint:
#    - floors  -> use the HIGHEST floor across manifests
#    - caps    -> use the MOST RESTRICTIVE (lowest) cap across manifests
# 3. Update every manifest to match.

# 4. (Consolidation) make pixi.toml the single source; regenerate the pip mirrors
pixi install
pixi run python scripts/sync_requirements.py
pixi run python scripts/check_dep_sync.py
pixi run python scripts/sync_requirements.py --check

# 5. Add a semantic-version regression guard, then run it
pytest tests/unit -k "dependency_floor or upper_cap or version_consistency" -v
```

Decision rules:

| Concern | Source-of-truth rule | Why |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Floor (`>=`) | Highest floor wins | Lower floors permit untested old majors |
| Upper-cap (`<`) | Lowest (most restrictive) cap wins | Higher caps permit untested new majors |
| `[workspace] version` | Delete it; `pyproject.toml [project] version` owns it | Optional in pixi; removal beats syncing |
| Unbounded `[pypi-dependencies]` | Add `<(installed_major + 1)` | Bound to a tested major without downgrading |
| Unbounded `python` pin in `[dependencies]` | Cap at one minor **above** the highest classifier (`>=3.10,<3.14` for classifiers ≤3.13) | Excludes the whole 3.14 line — including the experimental free-threaded `cp314t` build — while keeping the CI-tested 3.13 |

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Consolidate into pixi.toml as single source of truth

Map every package across `pixi.toml`, `pyproject.toml [project.dependencies]` /
`[project.optional-dependencies]`, `requirements.txt`, and `requirements-dev.txt`.
Identify missing packages, version conflicts (pinned version outside pixi range), and
ghost references (CI/Dockerfiles pointing at non-existent files).

Add missing packages to `pixi.toml`, grouped with inline comments, then strip the
duplicated declarations from `pyproject.toml` (keep `[tool.*]` config sections):

```toml
# pyproject.toml header after stripping duplicate deps:
# Dependencies are managed in pixi.toml (single source of truth).
# This file provides project metadata and tool configuration only.
```

Generate the pip mirrors from pixi-resolved versions (`scripts/sync_requirements.py`
reads `pixi list --json`) and add a CI guardrail (`scripts/check_dep_sync.py`) that
validates: every requirements package exists in pixi.toml, pinned versions satisfy pixi
ranges, and pyproject.toml has no leftover `[project.dependencies]`.

#### 2. Align FLOOR constraints across manifests (API-incompatible majors)

Use the **highest** floor as the source of truth. Example — PyGithub 1.x and 2.x are
API-incompatible and the code uses `Repository.stargazers_count` (2.9.1+):

```toml
# pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies.github]
"PyGithub>=2.9.1,<3",

# pixi.toml [dependencies]
pygithub = ">=2.9.1,<3"
```

#### 3. Align UPPER-CAP constraints across manifests

Use the **most restrictive** cap as the source of truth. Watch for multiple pixi feature
sections declaring the same dependency (e.g., `[feature.dev]` and `[feature.lint]`) — all
must agree. Example — mypy 1.x vs 2.x have different error semantics:

```toml
# pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies.dev]
"mypy>=1.8.0,<2",

# pixi.toml [feature.dev.dependencies]
mypy = ">=1.8.0,<2"

# pixi.toml [feature.lint.dependencies]
mypy = ">=1.8.0,<2"
```

#### 4. Dedup a duplicated [workspace] version

A `[workspace] version` in `pixi.toml` is optional metadata. Delete it instead of syncing
it, leaving `pyproject.toml [project] version` as the only source. Verify with
`pixi install --locked` (pixi does not require the field). Extend an existing
version-consistency check to detect re-introduction:

```diff
 [workspace]
 name = "project-hephaestus"
-version = "0.4.0"
 description = "Shared utilities and tooling for the HomericIntelligence ecosystem"
```

```python
# stdlib-only regex extraction (no tomllib dependency needed for this check):
r'\[project\]\s*\n(?:.*\n)*?version\s*=\s*"([^"]+)"'    # pyproject [project] version
r'\[workspace\]\s*\n(?:.*\n)*?version\s*=\s*"([^"]+)"'  # pixi [workspace] version -> None if absent
```

#### 5. PEP 440 semantic comparison guards (avoid string-equality traps)

Raw string comparison reports false drift because `"9.0" != "9.0.0"`, and naive
`split('.')` tuple comparison mishandles pre-releases/dev versions. Normalize with
`packaging.version.Version` before comparing, and extract versions with a robust PEP 508
helper rather than ad-hoc regex:

```python
from packaging.version import Version

assert "9.0" == "9.0.0"                  # False  ← trap: undetected drift
assert Version("9.0") == Version("9.0.0")  # True  ← safe

def _find_dep(specifier_string: str, pkg_name: str) -> str | None:
    """Extract a version from a PEP 508 specifier (e.g. 'pytest>=9.0' -> '9.0')."""
    if pkg_name not in specifier_string:
        return None
    remainder = specifier_string[specifier_string.find(pkg_name) + len(pkg_name):]
    # Strip operators longest-first so '==' is not eaten as '=' + '='
    for op in ["~=", "==", "!=", ">=", "<=", "<", ">", "="]:
        if remainder.startswith(op):
            remainder = remainder[len(op):]
            break
    for stop in [",", ";", "[", "]", " "]:
        if stop in remainder:
            remainder = remainder[:remainder.find(stop)]
    return remainder.strip() or None
```

A floor-extraction helper for the simpler `>=` case (stops before the cap):

```python
def _floor(spec: str) -> str:
    """'PyGithub>=2.9.1,<3' -> '2.9.1'."""
    if ">=" not in spec:
        raise AssertionError(f"No '>=' floor in spec: {spec}")
    return spec.split(">=", 1)[1].split(",")[0].strip()
```

Compare both files against **each other** (never against a hardcoded constant — that makes
the test a tautology), and test **both** files in every guard:

```python
assert Version(_floor(pyproject_spec)) == Version(_floor(pixi_spec)), (
    f"PyGithub floor skew: pyproject={pyproject_spec} vs pixi={pixi_spec}"
)
```

#### 6. Add explicit upper bounds to unbounded [pypi-dependencies]

Set the cap to `<(installed_major + 1)`, NOT `<installed_major` — the latter **downgrades**
the package and can reintroduce breakage. After tightening a bound, `pixi lock` may report
"already up-to-date"; force re-resolution with `pixi update <pkg>`, then `pixi install`,
then run the full test suite (a downgraded minor may break on your Python version).

```toml
# altair 6.0.0 installed & working on Python 3.14:
altair = ">=5.0,<6"   # BAD  — downgrades to 5.5.0 (TypedDict(closed=True) breaks on 3.14)
altair = ">=5.0,<7"   # GOOD — keeps 6.0.0
```

#### 6b. Cap the python interpreter pin itself (not just libraries)

The upper-cap rule applies to the **interpreter** too. An unbounded
`python = ">=3.10"` in `pixi.toml [dependencies]` lets pixi resolve to the newest
interpreter on conda-forge — including the experimental free-threaded (no-GIL) build
`python-3.14.4 ...cp314t`. Cap at **one minor above** the highest classifier: for
classifiers topping out at 3.13, use `python = ">=3.10,<3.14"` (keeps the CI-tested 3.13,
excludes the entire 3.14 line including `cp314t`). This is the same "cap one minor above
the last supported, not below it" rule from step 6 — extended to the interpreter pin.

```toml
# pixi.toml [dependencies] — classifiers top out at 3.13, CI matrix is 3.10–3.13:
python = ">=3.10"          # BAD  — resolves to python-3.14.4 cp314t (free-threaded, untested)
python = ">=3.10,<3.14"    # GOOD — keeps python-3.13.x cp313, excludes all of the 3.14 line
```

**Why `cp314t` is dangerous (concrete hazard):** free-threaded (no-GIL) builds break
`ProcessPoolExecutor` / `multiprocessing.Manager` proxies — they hang silently. Capping
it out removes a silent-hang runtime from the dev/lint envs.
(See [[state-machine-and-resource-lifecycle-patterns]] for the ProcessPool-hangs-on-3.14t
failure.)

**Force re-resolution and verify** — a bare `pixi lock` / `pixi install` may report
"already up-to-date" because the locked cp314t version still satisfies a *loosened* read;
run `pixi update python` to force it (verified on pixi 0.70.1):

```bash
pixi update python                       # force re-resolution; bare 'pixi lock' won't drop cp314t
grep -c cp314 pixi.lock                  # ACCEPTANCE: must be 0
pixi install                             # materialize the env
pixi run python -c "import sys; print(sys._is_gil_enabled())"  # must be True (GIL-ful build)
```

After re-resolution the env headers show `python-3.13.14 ...cp313`, and the `python-gil` +
`cpython` packages appear — the hallmark of the GIL-ful build.

**Judge the lock diff by package-name set, not line count.** The cp314t→cp313 switch can
touch ~40 URL lines / hundreds of insertions, but the only NEW packages should be expected
artifacts of leaving free-threaded mode — here `_python_abi3_support`, `ast-serialize`,
`cpython`, `python-gil`. Confirm no unrelated dependency entered/left, and that the lock is
**stable** (a second `pixi install` produces zero further churn — rules out hatch-vcs
self-reference churn; see [[tooling-pixi-lockfile-churn-self-reference]]):

```bash
grep -oE "(conda|pypi): [^ ]+" pixi.lock | sort -u > /tmp/after.txt   # diff old vs new package set
pixi install                                                          # second run must show zero churn
```

**An incidental transitive major bump is OK if it stays within the manifest cap.**
Re-resolving the interpreter dragged `mypy 1.20.2 → 2.1.0` in the lint env. Because that was
still within the declared cap (`mypy>=1.8.0,<3` in *both* pixi.toml and pyproject.toml) and
`pixi run mypy` stayed clean, it was accepted — not reflexively re-pinned. Lesson: a forced
re-resolution can drag transitive majors; verify they're still within the declared cap AND
that the dependent tool still passes, rather than pinning them down.

#### 6c. Regression-guard the interpreter ceiling (extend an existing script)

Extend an **existing** consistency script rather than adding a new file/hook. In
ProjectHephaestus the guard lives in
`hephaestus/scripts_lib/check_python_version_consistency.py` (already wired to the
`check-python-version-consistency` pre-commit hook on pixi.toml/pyproject.toml/workflow
changes). Add two functions and wire them into `main()` alongside the existing
`python_ok / project_version_ok / ci_matrix_ok` booleans:

```python
import re
from packaging.version import Version  # already a core dep — normalized comparison, never raw strings

def extract_pixi_python_ceiling(content: str) -> str | None:
    """Return the upper bound of the python pin in pixi.toml's *shared* [dependencies], or None.

    Section-bounded so a python pin under [feature.*.dependencies] is intentionally NOT
    matched — the bug lives in the shared base [dependencies] table that BOTH `default`
    and `lint` inherit.
    """
    m = re.search(r'\[dependencies\]\n(?:(?!\[).+\n)*?python\s*=\s*"([^"]+)"', content)
    if not m:
        return None
    cap = re.search(r'<=?\s*(\d+\.\d+)', m.group(1))
    return cap.group(1) if cap else None

def check_pixi_python_ceiling(repo_root) -> bool:
    """Fail if pixi's python pin is unbounded or caps above (highest classifier + 1 minor)."""
    hi = highest_classifier_version(repo_root)            # support ceiling from classifiers
    max_allowed = Version(f"{hi.major}.{hi.minor + 1}")
    ceiling = extract_pixi_python_ceiling(read_pixi_toml(repo_root))
    if ceiling is None or Version(ceiling) > max_allowed:
        return False
    return True
```

> **GOTCHA — two parallel modules with similar names; the plan named the wrong test file.**
> ProjectHephaestus has BOTH `hephaestus/scripts_lib/check_python_version_consistency.py`
> (pre-commit-wired, **content-string** API) AND `hephaestus/validation/python_version.py`
> (a separate `hephaestus-check-python-version` CLI entry point, **path-based** API, with
> its own `tests/unit/validation/test_python_version.py`). A plan said to add tests to

> `tests/unit/scripts_lib/test_check_python_version_consistency.py`. **Before adding tests to
> the file a plan names, `grep` its import line to confirm it actually imports the module you

>
> **SCOPE HYGIENE — repo-wide pre-commit hooks touch files you didn't change.** Running the
> ruff pre-commit hook auto-fixed an unrelated pre-existing file (a latent E501 in

> (empty) so it stayed OUT of the commit. After running pre-commit, re-check `git status`;
> revert any file the hooks touched that is not in your intended change set, confirming the
> issue is pre-existing on main rather than introduced by you.

#### 7a. Reuse existing `_find_dep` across new test classes (DRY)

When adding a new `TestXxxConsistency` class to an existing test file, do not copy-paste the
`_find_dep` static method. Call the already-defined version on the sibling class:

```python
class TestRuffConsistency:
    """Verify ruff floor is consistent across manifests."""

    @staticmethod
    def _find_dep(specifier_string: str, pkg_name: str) -> str | None:
        # Delegate to the sibling class — no duplication needed
        return TestPytestConsistency._find_dep(specifier_string, pkg_name)
```

Cross-class static-method delegation is valid Python. A reviewer will flag a verbatim copy
as a P4 DRY violation.

#### 7b. Locate the correct pixi.toml section before writing the guard

Tool-chain packages (ruff, mypy, pytest) may live in different `[feature.*]` sections. Verify
with a grep before writing the test assertion — do NOT assume the section name:

```bash
grep -n "ruff" pixi.toml
# ruff lives under [feature.shared.dependencies], NOT [feature.lint.dependencies]
```

The section determines the TOML key path used in the test:
`pixi["feature"]["shared"]["dependencies"]["ruff"]`.

#### 7c. No pixi re-solve needed when the lock already satisfies the new floor

When raising a floor (e.g., ruff `>=0.1.0` → `>=0.15`) and the current lock already
resolves a version ≥ the new floor, `pixi install` is a no-op. There is no need to run
`pixi update ruff` or `pixi lock` unless the new constraint explicitly excludes the locked
version.

#### 7. Lock it in (regression test + optional pre-commit)

Place the guard under your tests tree (e.g.,
`tests/unit/scripts/test_dependency_floor_consistency.py`) and, optionally, wire a
pre-commit hook that runs it whenever a manifest changes:

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: check-dependency-consistency
      name: Check dependency floor/cap consistency
      entry: pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_dependency_floor_consistency.py
      language: system
      files: (pyproject.toml|pixi.toml)
      pass_filenames: false
      always_run: true
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Raw string version comparison | `assert pyproject_floor == pixi_floor` with `"9.0"` vs `"9.0.0"` | `"9.0" != "9.0.0"` even though they are the same PEP 440 version; drift goes undetected | Normalize with `packaging.version.Version()` before comparing, never raw strings |
| `split('.')` tuple comparison | Parse `"9.0.0"`→`(9,0,0)`, pad with zeros | Fragile for pre-releases/dev/local versions (e.g., `9.0.0a1` vs `9.0a1`) | Delegate to `packaging.version.Version`, which handles PEP 440 edge cases |
| Naive regex `>=([0-9]+\.[0-9]+)` | Match only `X.Y` floors | Breaks on three-part versions and extras like `pytest-cov[toml]>=7.0` | Use a robust `_find_dep()` PEP 508 parser (operators longest-first, trims extras) |
| Hardcode the floor in the test | `assert Version("9.0") == Version(pixi_floor)` | Tautology; never catches real drift when the floor changes | Extract both floors from both files and compare them to each other |
| Check only one manifest | Assume pixi.toml follows pyproject.toml automatically | Maintainers edit one file and forget the other; drift accumulates silently | Parse and test every manifest in each guard |
| Bump only one manifest's cap | Set pixi.toml to `<2`, left pyproject.toml at `<3` | pip users still get the untested new major | All manifests must synchronize when declaring the same dependency |
| Cap at `<installed_major` | Set `altair = ">=5.0,<6"` while 6.0.0 was installed | Downgraded to 5.5.0, which broke on Python 3.14 (`TypedDict(closed=True)`) | Cap at `<(installed_major + 1)` and re-run tests after `pixi install` |
| `pixi lock` after tightening a bound | Expected lock to re-resolve to a newer allowed version | `pixi lock` reports "already up-to-date" if the locked version still satisfies the new constraint | Use `pixi update <pkg>` to force re-resolution, then `pixi install` |
| `pixi lock` / `pixi install` to drop `cp314t` | After capping `python = ">=3.10,<3.14"`, expected the lock to leave the free-threaded interpreter | Reported "already up-to-date" — the locked `cp314t` still satisfied the loosened read | Run `pixi update python` to force re-resolution; `grep -c cp314 pixi.lock` must return 0 |
| Tests added to the plan-named `test_python_version.py` | Plan said add guard tests to `tests/unit/validation/test_python_version.py` | That file tests `hephaestus/validation/python_version.py`, a DIFFERENT module from the `scripts_lib` guard that was changed | `grep` the test file's import line first; the paired test was `tests/unit/scripts_lib/test_check_python_version_consistency.py` |
| Let the ruff hook's incidental fix ride along | Repo-wide ruff pre-commit auto-fixed an unrelated pre-existing E501 file | The fix was out of scope and not introduced by this change — it polluted the commit's diff | Re-check `git status` after pre-commit; `git checkout --` any hook-touched out-of-scope file, confirm pre-existing via `git diff origin/main -- <file>` |
| `parents[4]` for repo root in tests | Computed project root from test file depth | In a git worktree this resolved to `.worktrees/`, not the project root | Verify depth with `Path(...).parents[i]` loop; here `parents[3]` was correct |
| `from scripts.X import Y` / `sys.path.insert` | Import check scripts as a package | `scripts/` has no `__init__.py`; pytest import machinery conflicts with sys.path hacks | Load with `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location()` for scripts without `__init__.py` |
| Hand-inspecting manifests | Manual verification of consistency | Error-prone; inconsistencies surface only after release | Regression tests lock consistency in permanently |
| Defining a new `_find_ruff_dep` static method | Plan draft defined `_find_ruff_dep` as a verbatim copy of `TestPytestConsistency._find_dep` with `"ruff"` hardcoded | DRY violation — `_find_dep` already accepts a `name` parameter; reviewer flagged as MAJOR P4/DRY finding | Call the existing `TestPytestConsistency._find_dep(dev_deps, "ruff")` directly from the new class; cross-class static delegation is valid Python |
| Hardcoded sentinel floor test | `assert floor >= Version("0.15")` in a test body | Goes stale silently when the lock bumps to 0.16.x without updating the test | Use a cross-manifest consistency test (`pyproject_floor == pixi_shared_floor`) instead — self-updating and non-tautological |
| Running a single test file with coverage gate | `pixi run pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_dependency_floor_consistency.py` alone | Triggers `fail-under=80` coverage gate because only a tiny slice of hephaestus is exercised | Use `--no-cov` when running a single file in isolation; rely on the full suite for coverage reporting |

```python
from packaging.version import Version

assert Version("9.0") == Version("9.0.0")   # equal: same PEP 440 version
assert Version("7.0") == Version("7.0.0")   # equal
assert Version("9.0") != Version("9.1")     # different: minor bump
assert Version("7.0") != Version("7.0.1")   # different: patch bump
```

### importlib pattern for test imports (scripts without `__init__.py`)

```python
import importlib.util
from pathlib import Path

_spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(
    "check_dep_sync", Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3] / "scripts" / "check_dep_sync.py"
)
_mod = importlib.util.module_from_spec(_spec)
_spec.loader.exec_module(_mod)
check_dep_sync = _mod.check_dep_sync
```

### Useful commands

```bash
grep -A2 "name: altair" pixi.lock                       # check locked version
pixi update altair                                       # force re-resolution after a bound change
pixi install                                             # apply lock changes to the active env
pixi run python -c "import altair; print(altair.__version__)"  # verify installed version
```

### Notes

- `tomllib` is stdlib in Python 3.11+ (fall back to `tomli` on 3.10); use it to parse
  manifests robustly instead of comparing raw constraint strings.
- Dependabot auto-appends a colon when `commit-message.prefix` ends in `)` (e.g.,
  `chore(deps)` → `chore(deps): ...`); document this in `.github/dependabot.yml`.
