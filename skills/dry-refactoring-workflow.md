description: "Complete TDD-driven workflow for identifying and eliminating code duplication by extracting reusable helper methods. Use when: (1) extracting duplicated helper methods into a shared module using TDD (write a failing test against the canonical, delete the duplicate, run green); (2) creating a private leaf module with leading-underscore naming to centralize a repeated internal call (e.g. importlib.metadata version resolution, path construction) and prevent re-introduction across modules; (3) centralizing hardcoded path constants into a single module to prevent drift when directory structure changes (incl. phase-routed in_progress/completed splits); (4) deduplicating LLM JSON extraction, parser logic, or any call-site pattern copy-pasted across several files; (5) test structure must mirror source structure when extracting helpers; (6) running a full DRY consolidation pass (discovery via grep, classifying true duplicates vs intentional variants, dict-structure consolidation) and refactoring to a single canonical source; (7) extract-method / SRP decomposition of over-long functions (50-LOC) and methods (100-LOC), including converting a mutating closure into a method via a small mutable box; (8) extracting repeated cached lookups into an @lru_cache helper (and clearing the cache so unittest.mock.patch works); (9) removing stale scripts / deprecated stubs (grep callers first) and replacing hardcoded file lists with dynamic Path.rglob discovery; (10) PLANNING a consolidation of two OVERLAPPING but not-identical constant collections (frozensets / keyword lists / error-pattern tuples) — classify true-duplicate vs intentional-variant first, then extract only the shared CORE into one canonical immutable constant and have each consumer compose CORE | its-own-extras, proving anti-drift with CORE.issubset(consumer) parity tests, instead of a flat merge that would violate a deliberate behavioral contract. (11) behavior-preserving duplicate cleanup across test fakes, tiny strategy/kernel modules, and validation wrappers: keep public module exports stable, centralize only identical mechanics, preserve local wrapper names/error messages, and verify with focused + full suites before opening a PR. Also covers cryptographic commit signing requirements in PR workflows. (12) stale issue body in dedup/consolidation tasks: issue 'Evidence:' sections go stale as prior PRs partially resolve them — grep the CURRENT state first; choose inlining over fixtures for pure bytes→str helpers; resolve remote branch divergence by pushing to a new branch rather than force-pushing or rebasing 84 conflicting commits. (13) PLANNING an extraction whose issue claims 'N nearly-identical, M byte-for-byte identical' methods: the COUNT and 'byte-for-byte identical' assertions go STALE exactly like the 'Evidence:' section — count and DIFF every claimed-duplicate body in full before scoping; prior refactors may have already delegated one to a richer printer or changed another's signature/model, and even the truly-similar bodies often hide call-site-varying string args (count noun, header) that a flat merge would silently change — parameterize those as kwargs-with-defaults to guarantee zero behavior change, and place the helper in an EXISTING established-dedup module rather than a new leaf module or base-class method. (14) PLANNING a behavior-preserving method→free-function extraction when the duplicated method is a patched test seam — grep patch.object(.*\"_method\") BEFORE planning any deletion (a method patched at many call sites must be KEPT as a one-line thin wrapper delegating to the new free function, never deleted, or every patch target breaks); read the actual test bodies to confirm which 'near-identical' differences (log level, an extra debug line, exception-message wording) are behavior-bearing vs incidental before collapsing copies (only safe to collapse logging when no test asserts log level/message); match the target module's established convention (free function taking explicit args, not a mixin/base-class method); hedge unverified import assumptions a planner did not execute (is pathlib.Path already imported? is there a 'from ._review_utils import ...' line to extend? is a cross-layer runtime import safe within the automation→library boundary AND absent from the base 'import hephaestus' surface?); and prove a pure extraction with a single-canonical-source grep that must return exactly one hit PLUS the PRE-EXISTING per-class behavioral suites staying green (the real acceptance gate, not the new structural tests). (15) PLANNING a duplicate-bearing standalone SCRIPT → library-shim consolidation when the script duplicates library logic (e.g. get_subpackages()/subpackage-mirror checks) but ALSO carries one unique function — prefer SHIM over DELETE: move the unique function into the library as the canonical source (returning a (ok, error_lines) tuple), export it from the package __init__, and rewrite the script as a thin shim importing the granular library functions — because the script is referenced by docs, a skill, AND auto-discovery smoke tests; the silent risk is OUTPUT-CONTRACT preservation: the shim must reproduce byte-for-byte stdout/stderr (literal arrow → and exact phrasing), calling the GRANULAR functions, NOT the library main()/check_test_structure (which runs extra checks the script never ran); importing a private symbol (_get_subpackages) across the script→library boundary is the most reviewer-contentious choice — offer a fallback (compute from already-returned data); record unverified reliances as explicit risks (is the script NOT wired to CI/pre-commit? does the doc/README line stay accurate once the shim is what's wired? is the single-vs-double-quote glob-marker check copied exactly?); and note the TDD INVERSION gotcha — a library test written AFTER copying the function body is GREEN-first, not RED, so don't claim a RED phase you didn't have."

# DRY Refactoring Workflow

Complete TDD-driven workflow for identifying and eliminating code duplication by extracting reusable helper methods.

## Overview

| Attribute | Details |
| ----------- | --------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-20 |
| **Objective** | TDD-driven extraction of duplicated code into reusable helper modules, with emphasis on private module placement, test structure mirroring, and cryptographic commit signing |
| **Outcome** | ✅ v1.0.0 (Feb 2026): Eliminated token aggregation duplication. v1.1.0 (Jun 2026): Extended with private module patterns, test mirroring enforcement, signing requirements. v1.3.0 (Jun 2026): Absorbed centralized path constants, LLM JSON extraction dedup, full DRY consolidation discovery/classify pass, and canonical-source refactor patterns (Pydantic type hierarchy, dict-structure consolidation, orphan relocation). v1.4.0 (Jun 2026): Restored SRP/extract-method (mutable-box closure), @lru_cache detection util (mock.patch/cache_clear gotcha), stale-script/stub cleanup, and dynamic Path.rglob discovery patterns from the nuance audit. ⚠️ v1.5.0 (Jun 2026, **planning-only / unverified**): Added Phase 10 — planning a consolidation of OVERLAPPING constant collections via the core/extras split (CORE \| consumer-extras) with subset parity anti-drift tests, classifying intentional-variant-with-overlap separately from "do not consolidate". v1.6.0 (Jun 2026): Added Radiance behavior-preserving duplicate cleanup pattern for route-test fakes, layout-only metric kernels, validation field wrappers, and stale tool deletion; verified locally with Ruff, full pytest, compileall, diff check, and pre-push pytest; PR CI pending. v1.7.0 (Jun 2026): Added Phase 12 — stale issue body in dedup tasks (grep current state, don't trust 'Evidence:' section); inline vs fixture decision for pure bytes→str helpers; remote branch divergence resolution (new branch vs force-push). Verified CI via ProjectHermes PR #652. ⚠️ v1.8.0 (Jun 2026, **planning-only / unverified**): Added Phase 13 — stale 'N identical duplicates' claims in extraction issues: count and DIFF every claimed-duplicate body before scoping (the duplicate COUNT and 'byte-for-byte identical' assertion go stale like 'Evidence:'); parameterize call-site-varying string args (count noun, failed-header) as kwargs-with-defaults to guarantee zero behavior change instead of flattening; prefer an EXISTING established-dedup home over a new leaf module. Captured from planning ProjectHephaestus issue #1381; NOT executed (no code, no tests, no CI). ⚠️ v1.9.0 (Jun 2026, **planning-only / unverified**): Added Phase 14 — planning a method→free-function extraction when the duplicated method is a patched test seam (#1383, `_load_impl_session_id` → `load_impl_session_id` in `_review_utils.py`): grep `patch.object` before any deletion and keep each method as a thin wrapper; read tests to separate behavior-bearing diffs (log level/message) from incidental ones before collapsing; match the target module's free-function convention; hedge unverified import/boundary assumptions; verify by single-hit canonical grep + EXISTING behavioral suites green. NOT executed end-to-end. ⚠️ v1.10.0 (Jun 2026, **planning-only / unverified**): Added Phase 15 — planning a duplicate-bearing standalone SCRIPT → library-shim consolidation (#1504, `scripts/check_unit_test_structure.py` duplicates `get_subpackages()`/subpackage-mirror logic in `hephaestus/validation/test_structure.py` but uniquely owns `check_scripts_coverage()`): SHIM over DELETE (the script is referenced by docs, a skill, and auto-discovery smoke tests); move the unique function into the library as canonical `(ok, error_lines)`, rewrite the script as a thin shim over the GRANULAR library functions while preserving byte-for-byte stdout/stderr (the silent output-contract risk); hedge the private-symbol import across the script→library boundary with a data-derived fallback; record unverified CI/pre-commit-wiring and doc-accuracy reliances; flag the TDD GREEN-first inversion (test written after copying the body is not RED). NOT executed (no code, no tests, no CI). |

## When to Use This Skill

Use this workflow when you encounter:

- **Code duplication**: Same logic appears in 2+ methods
- **DRY violations**: Identical patterns that should be abstracted
- **Refactoring tasks**: Need to improve code maintainability
- **Follow-up issues**: Code review identified duplication to fix

**Trigger phrases**:

- "Extract duplicate [X] logic"
- "Consolidate [X] code"
- "DRY violation in [method names]"
- "Create helper method for [pattern]"
- "Extract duplicated function calls into a helper module"
- "Private helper module placement — where should `_helper.py` go?"
- "How to structure tests for root-level private modules?"
- "Duplicated `importlib.metadata.version()` calls — consolidate into helper"
- "Centralize hardcoded path strings into a single `paths.py`"
- "Same JSON/LLM-response extraction logic copy-pasted across files"
- "Run a full DRY consolidation pass — find and classify duplicates"
- "Consolidate duplicate Pydantic models / type aliases into a base hierarchy"
- "Same dict structure built in multiple call sites — extract a shared helper"
- "This function/method is too long — extract methods / decompose by responsibility"
- "Convert a mutating closure into a standalone method"
- "Extract repeated cached lookups into an `@lru_cache` helper"
- "`@lru_cache` is breaking my `mock.patch` test — how to clear the cache?"
- "Remove stale scripts / deprecated stubs as part of consolidation"
- "Replace a hardcoded file list with dynamic `Path.rglob` discovery"
- "Two error-pattern / keyword lists overlap — should I merge them into one frozenset?"
- "Consolidate `TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS` and `NETWORK_ERROR_KEYWORDS` / two near-duplicate constant collections"
- "These two constant lists are 80% the same but one has extras — DRY them up"
- "Plan a DRY merge of overlapping constants without changing either matcher's behavior"
- "Consolidate duplicated server test fake apps / fake requests without changing route assertions"
- "Replace repeated tiny metric/operator kernel classes with one parameterized kernel while keeping module-level `KERNEL` exports stable"
- "Share validation type checks but preserve each module's exception class, wrapper function names, and error message text"
- "Remove an obsolete script and its Ruff exception after `rg` proves no first-party callers remain"
- "The issue says 4 files have the duplicate but only one actually does — how to discover the current state?"
- "Should I add a pytest fixture or just inline the shared helper call at each call site?"
- "Remote rejected my push with non-fast-forward — the remote branch has a different solution; what now?"
- "Extract a duplicated method into a shared free function, but the method is patched in tests — can I delete it?"
- "Two near-identical methods differ only in log level / an extra debug line — safe to collapse into one helper?"
- "Where should a shared cross-reviewer helper live — new leaf module, base class, or the existing `_review_utils.py`?"
- "I'm planning a refactor but haven't run anything — which import/boundary assumptions must the reviewer double-check?"
- "This standalone script duplicates library logic but has one unique function — delete it or shim it to the library?"
- "Plan a DRY shim: move the script's unique function into the library and rewrite the script as a thin delegating shim"
- "The script prints its own ERROR/OK lines — how do I preserve byte-for-byte stdout when delegating to the library?"
- "Is it OK to import a private `_get_subpackages` from the library into a sibling product script?"
- "I copied the function body into the library, then wrote a test — is that a real RED phase?"
- "Should the shim call the library's `main()`/`check_test_structure`, or the granular `check_*` functions?"
- "The issue says there are many `logging.basicConfig` callers — how do I verify the current count before planning?"
- "Refactor direct `basicConfig` callers through `setup_logging` without changing stderr/stdout, datefmt, JSON, or file-handler behavior"
- "Remove C901 suppressions from flag-based CLI entrypoints by extracting helper functions"
- "A stale issue mentions subcommands, but the current argparse parser is flag-based — how should the plan avoid inventing dispatch?"

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# --- DISCOVERY: find duplicate symbols / hardcoded strings ---
grep -rh "^def [a-z_]"  src/ --include="*.py" | sed 's/(.*//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -30
grep -rh "^class [A-Z]" src/ --include="*.py" | sed 's/(.*//;s/://' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -30
grep -rn '"agent"\|"judge"\|"result\.json"' src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "^[[:space:]]*#"

# --- PATH-CONSTANT BYPASS AUDIT (run before merging dir-structure changes) ---

# --- TDD loop: write failing test, implement helper, go green ---
<package-manager> run pytest tests/unit/<module>/test_<file>.py -v   # RED then GREEN
<package-manager> run pytest tests/ -q                              # no regressions
pre-commit run --files <changed-files>
git commit -S -m "refactor(scope): consolidate <X> into canonical helper"  # -S if pr-policy gate
```

Core loop: **discover → classify (true duplicate vs intentional variant) → write failing test → extract canonical → migrate call sites one at a time → verify green → signed commit + auto-merge PR.**

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

1. **Identify duplication** - Find exact duplicate code blocks

   ```bash
   # Search for the pattern
   grep -n "pattern" path/to/file.py
   ```

2. **Verify identical logic** - Confirm both instances do the same thing
   - Check for any subtle differences
   - Note any conditional variations

3. **Choose placement** - Place helper near related private methods
   - After similar helper methods
   - Before the methods that will use it
   - Maintain logical grouping

### Phase 2: Test-Driven Development

**IMPORTANT**: Always write tests BEFORE implementing the helper method.

1. **Create test file** if it doesn't exist

   ```python
   # tests/unit/<module>/test_<class>.py
   from pathlib import Path
   from unittest.mock import MagicMock
   import pytest

   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_config() -> ConfigClass:
       """Create mock config for testing."""
       return ConfigClass(
           required_field="value",
           # Add all required fields
       )
   ```

2. **Write comprehensive tests**
   - Empty/None input case
   - Single item case
   - Multiple items case
   - Edge cases (zeros, special values)

3. **Run tests to verify they fail**

   ```bash
   pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit/<module>/test_<class>.py -v
   ```

   - Confirm `AttributeError: object has no attribute '<method>'`

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. **Extract helper method**

   ```python
   def _helper_method(self, input_data: dict[K, V]) -> Result:
       """Brief description of what this does.

       Args:
           input_data: Description of the input

       Returns:
           Description of the return value. Explain edge case behavior
           (e.g., "Returns empty Result if input_data is empty").
       """
       from functools import reduce  # Import at function level if needed

       if not input_data:
           return Result()  # Handle empty case

       return reduce(
           lambda a, b: a + b,
           [v.attribute for v in input_data.values()],
           Result(),  # Identity element
       )
   ```

2. **Run tests to verify implementation**

   ```bash
   pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit/<module>/test_<class>.py -v
   ```

   - All new tests should pass

### Phase 4: Refactoring

1. **Update first call site**

   ```python
   # Before:
   from functools import reduce
   result = reduce(
       lambda a, b: a + b,
       [v.attribute for v in data.values()],
       Result(),
   ) if data else Result()

   # After:
   result = self._helper_method(data)
   ```

2. **Update second call site** - Same transformation

3. **Run full test suite**

   ```bash
   pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit/<module>/ -v --tb=short -x
   ```

   - Verify no regressions

### Phase 5: Quality Checks

1. **Run pre-commit hooks**

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --files path/to/modified/files
   ```

   - Fix any formatting issues
   - Address type checking errors

2. **Verify all checks pass**

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --files path/to/modified/files
   ```

### Phase 6: Commit & PR

1. **Stage changes**

   ```bash
   git add path/to/implementation.py tests/unit/path/test_file.py
   ```

2. **Create descriptive commit**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   refactor(module): Extract duplicate [X] logic

   Extract duplicate [description] from method1() and method2()
   into a new helper method _helper_name().

   This refactoring:
   - Eliminates code duplication (DRY principle)
   - Improves maintainability
   - Provides comprehensive test coverage
   - Maintains identical functionality

   Changes:
   - Add _helper_name() helper method in file.py:LINE1-LINE2
   - Refactor method1() to use new helper (line N)
   - Refactor method2() to use new helper (line M)
   - Add comprehensive unit tests in test_file.py

   All X tests pass with no regressions.

   Closes #ISSUE

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

3. **Push and create PR**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin BRANCH-NAME

   gh pr create \
     --title "refactor(module): Extract duplicate [X] logic" \
     --body "PR_BODY" \
     --label "refactoring"

   gh pr merge --auto --rebase PR_NUMBER
   ```

### Phase 7: Private Module Extraction (NEW in v1.1.0)

When extracting duplicates spans multiple modules, create a **private helper module** with leading-underscore naming:

1. **Place as a leaf module at package root** to avoid circular imports:

   ```text
   hephaestus/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── _version_lookup.py          # Private helper — leaf module, not a package
   ├── agents/
   ├── utils/
   └── ...
   ```

   **Why not a package?** Private packages (`_internal/`) with `__init__.py` can trigger circular imports if imported from multiple sibling modules that also depend on the package.
   Leaf modules (`_version_lookup.py`) avoid this by having no sub-modules.

2. **Store module-level constants in the helper** — especially PyPI distribution names that must NOT be guessed or normalized:

   ```python
   # hephaestus/_version_lookup.py
   """Internal helper for version resolution via importlib.metadata."""

   from importlib.metadata import PackageNotFoundError, version as _pkg_version

   # CRITICAL: This is the literal [project].name from pyproject.toml
   # importlib.metadata does NOT normalize between distribution and import names
   _DIST_NAME = "HomericIntelligence-Hephaestus"

   def lookup_version() -> str:
       """Resolve package version from installed metadata.

       Returns:
           Version string from most recent git tag, or "unknown" if not found.
       """
       try:
           return _pkg_version(_DIST_NAME)
       except PackageNotFoundError:
           return "unknown"
   ```

3. **Test structure mirroring** — Root-level private modules must have tests in a logical sub-package:

   ```text
   tests/unit/
   ├── version/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── test_version_lookup.py    # Test for hephaestus/_version_lookup.py
   └── ...
   ```

   **Pre-commit enforcement:** `test_*.py` files CANNOT live directly under `tests/unit/`. They must be in sub-directories that mirror the package structure. This enforces organization and catches orphaned test files.

4. **Cryptographic commit signing requirement** — All commits in PRs must be signed:

   ```bash
   # Commit with mandatory -S flag
   git commit -S -m "refactor: consolidate duplicate version resolution

   Extract duplicated importlib.metadata.version() calls into
   _version_lookup helper module.

   Key learnings:
   - Private modules use leading underscore (_module.py)
   - Store PyPI dist name as module constant (not guessed at runtime)
   - Root-level helpers go in tests/unit/category/ for test organization
   - All commits must be cryptographically signed (-S)
   - pr-policy CI gate validates every commit at GraphQL layer

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Haiku 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

   # Verify commit was actually signed
   git log -1 --pretty=format:'%G?'   # Must print 'G', not 'N' or 'B'
   ```

   **CI validation:** The `pr-policy` required-check gate validates commit signatures at the GraphQL layer before allowing merge. Unsigned commits block auto-merge even if all other checks pass.

### Phase 8: Specific Consolidation Patterns (NEW in v1.3.0)

These are concrete instances of the workflow above, absorbed from dedicated skills.

#### 8a. Centralized Path Constants

Eliminate hardcoded path strings by routing every path through one `paths.py` module. Critical when a directory structure has phases (e.g. `in_progress/` vs `completed/`) — routing must live at a single point or bypass violations appear at every construction site.

```python
# paths.py — single source of truth
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

IN_PROGRESS_DIR = "in_progress"
COMPLETED_DIR = "completed"
AGENT_DIR = "agent"
RESULT_FILE = "result.json"

def get_agent_dir(run_dir: Path) -> Path:
    return run_dir / AGENT_DIR

# Phase-routed: keyword-only completed= keeps active-work callers unchanged
def get_tier_dir(experiment_dir: Path, tier_id: str, *, completed: bool = False) -> Path:
    phase = COMPLETED_DIR if completed else IN_PROGRESS_DIR
    return experiment_dir / phase / tier_id

def promote_run_to_completed(experiment_dir, tier_id, subtest_id, run_num) -> Path:
    src = get_run_dir(experiment_dir, tier_id, subtest_id, run_num, completed=False)
    dst = get_run_dir(experiment_dir, tier_id, subtest_id, run_num, completed=True)
    dst.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    shutil.move(str(src), str(dst))
    # copy (NOT move) shared baseline so sibling runs can also be promoted
    baseline = src.parent / "pipeline_baseline.json"
    if baseline.exists():
        shutil.copy2(str(baseline), str(dst.parent / "pipeline_baseline.json"))
    return dst
```

**Pre-merge bypass audit** (run before merging any directory-structure change — must return zero hits):

```bash
grep -rn "experiment_dir / \|experiment_dir/" src/ scripts/ \
  | grep -v "paths.py" | grep -v "# noqa" | grep -v "__pycache__" | grep -v ".pyc"
```

`completed=` routing decision: `False` for in-flight execution; `True` for judging, reporting, rehydration/resume, aggregation; pass both only for repair/reconcile commands. In one ProjectScylla split, skipping this audit left 17 silent wrong-dir reads post-merge — the grep would have found them in 5 seconds.

#### 8b. Deduplicate LLM JSON Extraction

When the same JSON-extraction-from-LLM-output logic is copy-pasted across 3+ files (and a bug lives in only one copy), extract the **most robust** copy into a shared utility rather than fixing one place and creating a 4th variant.

```python
# <module>/utils.py — keep the version that handles the most formats
def extract_json_from_llm_response(output: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    r"""Extract a JSON object from LLM output.

    Handles raw JSON, ```json``` / ``` code blocks, XML-tag-wrapped JSON with
    preamble, and JSON surrounded by explanatory text via brace-matching.

    Returns parsed dict, or None if no valid JSON object found.
    """
    ...  # paste the most robust brace-matching implementation
```

Selection criteria for the canonical copy: most robust (handles most edge cases) > best tested > most recent > clearest. Export it from `<module>/__init__.py`, then replace every duplicate with a one-line delegation. Add a regression test for the originally-failing input (e.g. XML-wrapped JSON with preamble). Use `r"""` for docstrings containing backslashes (ruff `D301`). Verify any "new" full-suite failures pre-exist on `main` via `git stash` before blaming your change.

#### 8c. Full DRY Consolidation Discovery + Classification Pass

For a whole-codebase cleanup, discover systematically then classify before touching anything.

```bash
# Discovery
find src/ -type f \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.mojo" \) -exec md5sum {} + \
  | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20          # identical files
grep -rh "^def [a-z_]"  src/ --include="*.py" | sed 's/(.*//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn  # dup funcs
grep -rh "^class [A-Z]" src/ --include="*.py" | sed 's/(.*//;s/://' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn  # dup classes
```

| Type | Criteria | Action |
| ------ | --------- | ------- |
| **True duplicate** | Identical/near-identical logic, same purpose | Create/extend canonical module; delete copies; update callers |
| **Intentional variant** | Different fields/domain/pipeline stage | Add cross-reference docstrings (`see: other/module.py:Name`); do NOT consolidate |
| **Weaker vs stronger** | Same intent, one validates content, one only checks existence | Keep stronger; update callers and test fixtures |

Search team knowledge first (`/advise`), read both implementations in full before acting, verify imports with the project package manager, and run the full suite before/after.

#### 8d. Pydantic Type-Alias Hierarchy Consolidation

Unify duplicate Pydantic models into a base + domain subtypes, keeping a backward-compat alias so old imports keep working:

```python
class ExecutionInfoBase(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    exit_code: int = Field(...)
    duration_seconds: float = Field(default=0.0)   # default, not required

class ExecutorExecutionInfo(ExecutionInfoBase):
    container_id: str = Field(...)

ExecutionInfo = ExecutorExecutionInfo               # old imports still work
result = result.model_copy(update={"duration_seconds": elapsed})  # frozen → model_copy, not assignment
```

#### 8e. Dict-Structure Consolidation (Shared Payload)

When the same dict shape is built in multiple call sites (format function + CLI output), extract one private helper so the shape can't drift:

```python
def _serializable_stats(stats: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Canonical JSON-serializable shape for agent stats."""
    return {
        "agent_type": stats.get("agent_type"),
        "total_delegations": stats.get("total_delegations", 0),
        "skill_refs": stats.get("skill_refs", []),
        "timestamp": stats.get("timestamp"),
    }

def format_stats_json(stats): return json.dumps(_serializable_stats(stats))
def main(): cli_output = json.dumps(_serializable_stats(stats))
```

Add a regression test asserting shape parity between the call sites so future fields stay in sync.

#### 8f. Orphan Module Relocation (Preserve History)

```bash
cp package/orphan.py package/subpackage/orphan.py          # prefer existing sub-package (KISS)
grep -rn "from package\.orphan\|import package\.orphan" --include="*.py" .  # find consumers
<package-manager> run python -c "from package.subpackage.orphan import Class; print('OK')"
git rm package/orphan.py                                    # git rm (not rm) → records a rename
grep -rn "from package\.orphan" .                           # must be empty before commit
```

### Phase 9: Additional DRY-Consolidation Patterns (NEW in v1.4.0)

Further consolidation patterns restored from `dry-consolidate-to-canonical-refactor`.

#### Detailed Steps

**9a. Extract-method / SRP decomposition.** Long functions/methods both violate Single Responsibility and hide duplication. Treat size as a smell trigger, not a hard rule: **functions > ~50 LOC** and **methods > ~100 LOC** are extraction candidates. Pull each distinct responsibility into its own named helper.

A common snag: a closure that mutates a variable captured from the enclosing scope cannot be lifted into a standalone method as-is (Python rebinding makes the captured name local). Wrap the mutable state in a small **mutable box** — a one-field dataclass or a single-element `list` cell — and pass it in:

```python
# Before: closure mutates captured `total` — can't be extracted cleanly
def process(items):
    total = 0
    def add(x):            # `nonlocal` ties this to the enclosing frame
        nonlocal total
        total += x
    for i in items:
        add(i)
    return total

# After: mutable box makes the helper a free-standing, testable method
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class _Accumulator:
    total: int = 0

def _add(box: _Accumulator, x: int) -> None:
    box.total += x          # mutates the box's field, not a captured local

def process(items: list[int]) -> int:
    box = _Accumulator()
    for i in items:
        _add(box, i)
    return box.total
# (a single-element list `box = [0]` / `box[0] += x` works too for trivial cases)
```

**9b. LRU-cache detection util.** When the same expensive lookup is recomputed at many call sites (config resolution, path discovery, metadata reads), extract it into one `@lru_cache`-decorated helper so it is computed once:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def resolve_root() -> Path:
    """Locate project root once; cached for the process lifetime."""
    ...  # expensive walk / import
```

**Gotcha — `@lru_cache` conflicts with `unittest.mock.patch`.** The cache holds the value computed *before* the patch was applied, so the mock is never seen. Call `helper.cache_clear()` in the test (and between successive patches):

```python
def test_resolve_root(monkeypatch):
    resolve_root.cache_clear()           # drop any pre-patch cached value
    monkeypatch.setattr(module, "_walk", fake_walk)
    resolve_root.cache_clear()           # ensure the patched impl is used
    assert resolve_root() == expected
```

Prefer a `cache_clear()` in setup/teardown (or an autouse fixture) for any module exposing `@lru_cache` helpers.

**9c. Stale-script removal & deprecated-stub cleanup.** Consolidation leaves behind stale scripts and deprecated stubs — remove them as part of the pass, but **grep for callers first**; a deletion is only safe once nothing references it:

```bash
grep -rn "stale_script\.py\|deprecated_stub\|old_entrypoint" \
  --include="*.py" --include="*.md" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.yml" --include="*.sh" .
```

If a file you are keeping holds a **stale back-reference** to something being deleted, rewrite that file to be **self-contained first** (inline the still-needed logic / update the docstring), commit and verify, and only then delete the stale target. Deleting first leaves a dangling reference that breaks imports or docs.

**9d. Dynamic discovery via `Path.rglob`.** Replace hardcoded file lists (which silently rot as files are added/removed) with dynamic discovery so the set is always current:

```python
# Before: hardcoded list drifts out of sync with the tree
SKILL_FILES = ["a.md", "b.md", "c.md"]

# After: discovered at runtime — new/removed files are picked up automatically
from pathlib import Path
skill_files = sorted(Path("skills").rglob("*.md"))
```

Sort the result for deterministic ordering and filter excludes explicitly (e.g. skip `*.notes.md` / `__pycache__`) rather than re-introducing a hardcoded allowlist.

### Phase 10: Overlapping Constant Collections — Core/Extras Split (NEW in v1.5.0, PLANNING-ONLY)

> **Warning:** This phase is a **proposed workflow** captured from PLANNING ProjectHephaestus
> issue #1205. It was **NOT validated end-to-end** — no code was written, no tests were run,
> and no CI confirmed it. Treat every step below as a hypothesis until CI confirms it on a
> real PR. The rest of this skill is `verified-ci`; this phase alone is unverified.

**The trap this phase exists to avoid:** when two duplicate-*looking* constant collections
(frozensets, keyword lists, error-pattern tuples) are flagged for DRY consolidation, the
naive move is a flat merge into one shared frozenset. But "looks duplicated" is not
"is duplicated." Two collections can overlap heavily yet carry **deliberate,
behavior-bearing differences** — an *intentional variant with overlap*. A flat merge
silently violates one consumer's contract or breaks one consumer's test.

This is a **refinement of the Phase 8c classification table.** Phase 8c offered two
end-states for an intentional variant: "do NOT consolidate" (cross-reference docstrings)
vs full consolidation. Phase 10 adds a **third, middle path** for the overlapping case:
consolidate *only the shared CORE*, keep each consumer's extras local.

#### Quick Reference

```text
discover two duplicate-looking collections
  └─ CLASSIFY: true-duplicate (same intent) ── or ── intentional-variant (deliberate diffs)?
       ├─ true duplicate            → flat-merge into one canonical constant (Phase 8c)
       ├─ variant, NO overlap       → do NOT consolidate; cross-reference docstrings (Phase 8c)
       └─ variant WITH overlap      → CORE/EXTRAS split (THIS phase):
             1. extract genuinely-shared CORE into ONE canonical immutable frozenset
             2. each consumer = CORE | <its own layer-specific extras>
             3. add parity tests: CORE.issubset(consumer_A) AND CORE.issubset(consumer_B)
             4. keep PUBLIC NAMES + iterable types; recompose only their VALUES
             5. real acceptance gate = the EXISTING behavioral suites stay green
```

#### The #1205 worked example

`TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS` (resilience layer) and `NETWORK_ERROR_KEYWORDS` (retry layer)
overlapped on transient-failure substrings. But `NETWORK_ERROR_KEYWORDS` *additionally*
held `"rate limit"` / `"throttle"`, which the resilience layer **deliberately omits** —
its documented contract is *"rate limit error passthrough (not retried)"*. A naive shared
frozenset would either (a) make the resilience layer retry rate-limit errors (contract
violation) or (b) drop rate-limit/throttle from the network tagger (breaks an existing
test). Neither is acceptable. The core/extras split preserves both contracts.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Discover, then CLASSIFY before touching anything.** Read BOTH collections and their
   surrounding docstrings/tests in full. Ask: is every element shared by *intent*, or does
   one collection carry elements the other *deliberately excludes*? A module docstring
   contract line ("rate limit error passthrough — not retried") or an existing test that
   asserts an exclusion is your signal that you are looking at an intentional variant, not
   drift. **If you cannot confirm the difference is deliberate, stop and confirm it** —
   the whole split is mis-scoped if the "intentional" difference is actually stale.

2. **Extract only the genuinely-shared CORE** into one canonical immutable constant. Use a
   `frozenset` (immutable, set-algebra-friendly). Put it in a **leaf module both consumers
   can import with no cycle, respecting the architecture boundary** — in Hephaestus this was
   the pre-existing `hephaestus/constants.py` (stdlib-only, already holds shared frozensets).
   **Never** place it in the product/automation layer (the library may not import automation),
   and avoid sub-package `__init__.py` (circular-import risk).

   ```python
   # hephaestus/constants.py  (leaf, stdlib-only, no cycle)
   # Shared CORE of transient-failure substrings used by BOTH the resilience
   # retry matcher and the network-error tagger. Lowercase; matched as substrings.
   TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE: frozenset[str] = frozenset({
       "timeout", "timed out", "connection", "network", "temporarily",
       "unavailable", "reset by peer", "broken pipe",
   })
   ```

3. **Each consumer composes its full collection as `CORE | <its own extras>`** —
   keeping the **public names and existing iterable types** so call sites that iterate
   them (`any(p in err for p in NAME)`) and exported-symbol consumers keep working. Only
   the *values* are recomposed from the core.

   ```python
   # resilience layer — intentionally does NOT include rate-limit/throttle
   from hephaestus.constants import TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE
   # exact phrases kept as explicit extras (see trap #2 below)
   _RESILIENCE_EXTRAS = frozenset({"connection refused", "connection reset"})
   TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS = tuple(sorted(TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE | _RESILIENCE_EXTRAS))

   # retry/network layer — ADDS rate-limit/throttle by deliberate contract
   from hephaestus.constants import TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE
   _NETWORK_EXTRAS = frozenset({"rate limit", "throttle"})
   NETWORK_ERROR_KEYWORDS = tuple(sorted(TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE | _NETWORK_EXTRAS))
   ```

4. **Add subset parity (anti-drift) tests** so the shared signals can never silently drift
   out of either consumer — this is what makes the plan *reviewable*:

   ```python
   from hephaestus.constants import TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE
   from hephaestus.resilience import TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS
   from hephaestus.retry import NETWORK_ERROR_KEYWORDS

   def test_core_present_in_both_consumers():
       assert TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE.issubset(set(TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS))
       assert TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE.issubset(set(NETWORK_ERROR_KEYWORDS))
   ```

   Plus standard constants-module tests (see the `testing-python-constants-module` skill):
   `isinstance(CORE, frozenset)`, all-lowercase, immutability (`AttributeError` on `.add()`),
   and parametrized membership of each expected substring.

5. **TDD RED → GREEN.** The parity + constants tests fail first with `ImportError`
   (`TRANSIENT_ERROR_CORE` does not exist yet); create the constant to go green.

6. **Grep ALL file types for orphaned refs** to the old literals after recomposing.

7. **The REAL acceptance gate is the EXISTING behavioral suites, not the new constant
   tests.** Run `test_retry.py`, `test_subprocess_resilience.py`, etc. — every behavioral
   matcher test must stay green. New constant tests proving structure are necessary but
   insufficient; behavior is the contract.

8. Signed commit + auto-merge per the standard PR workflow above.

### Phase 11: Behavior-Preserving Duplicate Cleanup Across Tests, Kernels, and Validation Wrappers (NEW in v1.6.0)

Use this when an audit finds several low-risk duplicate surfaces in one Python repository, but
runtime behavior must remain stable.

#### Quick Reference

```bash
# Find repeated fake app/request route scaffolding.
rg -n "class _FakeRequest|class _FakeApp|def route\(" tests/radiance/server tests/project/release -g "*.py"

# Find repeated tiny kernel classes delegating to the same estimator.
rg -n "class (Flatten|Reshape|Permute|Transpose|View)Kernel|estimate_layout_reindex" radiance/metrics/ops -g "*.py"

# Find repeated validation field wrappers.
rg -n "def _required_mapping|def _required_list|def _required_string|def _as_mapping" radiance/*validation.py

# Behavior-preserving verification gate.
./.venv/bin/python -m ruff check radiance scripts tests --no-cache
./.venv/bin/pytest -q
./.venv/bin/python -m compileall radiance scripts tests
git diff --check
```

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Centralize test-only HTTP fakes in tests, not production.** If several route tests define
   `_FakeRequest`, `_FakeApp`, and identical `route()` decorators, create a local test support
   module. Keep variants explicit by storage shape: rule -> handler, rule -> list[handler],
   `(rule, method) -> handler`, `(method, rule) -> handler`, or registration-order list.
   This removes decorator duplication without making assertions harder to read.
2. **Extract only the invariant mechanics.** For fake route apps, share the decorator and route
   method normalization once, then let tiny subclasses/adapters record routes in the shape each
   test already expects. Do not force every test into one awkward route index.
3. **Replace repeated tiny strategy classes with one parameterized instance.** If modules differ
   only by `supported_ops` and call the same estimator, keep each module's public `KERNEL` export
   but construct it from the shared class, e.g. `KERNEL = LayoutReindexKernel(("flatten", ...))`.
   This preserves provider registration behavior while deleting boilerplate classes.
4. **Preserve validation API/error contracts with local wrappers.** When modules use different
   exception classes or message wording, do not import one module's helper into another. Instead,
   create generic low-level checks that accept `error_type` and exact message strings, then keep
   the existing `_required_mapping` / `_required_string` wrappers in each module.
5. **Delete stale large scripts only after a caller audit.** Run `rg` for the filename, import
   name, CLI reference, docs, and CI exception. Remove the file and remove only the specific lint
   exception/test expectation tied to it.
6. **Run focused tests first, then full gates.** Execute the touched server tests, touched
   validation tests, metric alias tests, then full Ruff/pytest/compileall/diff-check. If the repo
   has a pre-push hook, treat its full pytest rerun as an additional local signal, not CI.

### Phase 12: Stale Issue Body, Inline vs Fixture, and Remote Branch Divergence (NEW in v1.7.0)

Concrete lessons from ProjectHermes issue #329 — deduplicating a `_sign()` HMAC-SHA256 test
helper across 4 files.

#### 12a. Grep FIRST — issue "Evidence:" sections go stale

Issue bodies list the *original* state of the codebase. Prior PRs may have partially resolved
the duplication without closing the issue. The evidence in the body reflects the state at issue
creation, not the current HEAD.

```bash
# ALWAYS do this BEFORE reading the issue "Evidence:" list:
grep -rn "def _sign\|def sign_body\|from tests.helpers import" tests/ --include="*.py"
```

In #329, the body listed 4 files with a copy-pasted `_sign()`. By the time the work began:
- A canonical `sign_body(body, secret)` already lived in `tests/helpers.py`
- Three of the four files already imported and used `sign_body`
- Only one file (`test_integration.py`) still had a thin local wrapper

**Rule:** grep for the current call count/definition count before scoping the work. An "N-file
dedup" issue may be a "1-file cleanup" when you get there.

#### 12b. Inline vs fixture decision for pure test helpers

When a thin wrapper is a pure `bytes → str` function that:
- Closes over a **module-local** constant (e.g. `INTEGRATION_TEST_SECRET`, different from the shared `TEST_SECRET` in helpers.py)
- Has a small number of call sites (< ~10)
- Does no setup/teardown

**Prefer inlining** the canonical call directly at each site (`sign_body(body_bytes, SECRET)`)
over:
- Adding a new pytest **fixture** — overkill for a pure function, leaks the fixture name into unrelated test function signatures
- Adding a new entry in **conftest.py** — unnecessary indirection when the function is already importable

Decision table for deduplicating a test helper:

| Helper type | Call pattern | Preferred approach |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Pure function, module-local secret | `fn(body, LOCAL_SECRET)` | **Inline** the canonical call |
| Pure function, shared secret | `fn(body, SHARED_SECRET)` | Import from `tests/helpers.py`, inline |
| Stateful / async setup | fixture or async_generator | pytest fixture in conftest |
| Complex parametrized prep | multiple args, reused shape | pytest fixture |

#### 12c. Remote branch divergence — push to a new branch

When `git push` is rejected (non-fast-forward) because the remote branch has diverged with a
different solution:

```bash
# DON'T: force-push — overwrites the remote solution entirely
git push --force  # NO

# DON'T: rebase onto a conflicting remote — may produce 80+ conflict-laden commits
git pull origin <remote-branch>  # triggers merge/rebase with 84 commits and multiple conflicts
git rebase --abort               # bail out

# DO: push as a new branch and open a PR against main
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>          # e.g. 329-inline-sign-calls
git push -u origin <new-branch-name>
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
```

The remote branch's competing solution becomes a sibling PR. The project maintainer merges
whichever approach is preferred. This is safer than force-pushing because it preserves both
solutions for review.

### Phase 13: Stale "N identical duplicates" claims in extraction issues — count and DIFF before scoping (NEW in v1.8.0, PLANNING-ONLY)

> **Warning:** This phase is a **proposed workflow** captured from PLANNING ProjectHephaestus
> issue #1381 ("Extract shared `print_worker_summary` helper"). It was **NOT validated
> end-to-end** — no code was written, no tests were run, and no CI confirmed it. Treat every
> step below as a hypothesis until CI confirms it on a real PR. The rest of this skill is
> `verified-ci` (except Phase 10, which is also planning-only); this phase alone is unverified.

**The trap this phase exists to avoid:** an extraction issue confidently states a duplicate
COUNT and a strength claim ("6 nearly-identical methods, 5 byte-for-byte identical"). That
count and the "byte-for-byte identical" assertion go **stale exactly like the issue's
'Evidence:' section** (Phase 12a). Prior refactors silently erode them: one duplicate may
have already been delegated to a richer printer class, another may operate on a different
model with a different signature. And even the bodies that *are* still similar often hide
call-site-varying string literals that a naive flat merge would silently change. This phase
is a **refinement of Phase 12a** (stale Evidence) applied to the *duplicate count and
identical-ness claim* specifically, plus a **refinement of Phase 8c classify-before-merge**
applied to a *shared function's call-site-varying string args* rather than to constant
collections.

#### Quick Reference

```text
issue claims "N nearly-identical, M byte-for-byte identical" methods
  └─ DON'T trust the count. For EACH claimed duplicate:
       1. grep its definition + READ the full body
       2. DIFF the bodies against each other (not just eyeball them)
       3. drop out-of-scope ones: already-delegated to a richer printer,
          different signature, different model (e.g. PlanResult vs WorkerResult)
  └─ among the REAL duplicates, find call-site-varying literals
       (e.g. "Total PRs:" vs "Total issues:"; leading-newline header vs none)
       └─ PARAMETERIZE them as kwargs-with-defaults (count_noun=, failed_header=)
          → guarantees ZERO behavior change, vs a flat merge that flattens them away
  └─ PLACEMENT: prefer an EXISTING established-dedup module that already fits the
       boundary over a new leaf module or a new base-class method
```

#### The #1381 worked example

The issue claimed **6** `_print_summary` methods, "5 byte-for-byte identical." Grepping and
reading all 6 bodies in full showed only **4** were true duplicates:

- `IssueImplementer._print_summary` had already been refactored to delegate to a richer
  printer class (`ImplementationSummaryPrinter`) — out of scope.
- `Planner._print_summary` had a different signature and operated on a different model
  (`PlanResult` vs `WorkerResult`) — out of scope.

So an issue scoped as "6 methods, ~100 lines removed" was really "4 methods, ~70 lines."
Even among the 4 "identical" methods, two real behavioral differences would have been
silently changed by a flat merge:

1. one logged `"Total PRs:"` where the other three logged `"Total issues:"`;
2. two used a leading-newline header `"\nFailed issues:"` and two did not.

The fix is to **parameterize** these as keyword arguments with defaults
(`count_noun="issues"`, `failed_header="Failed issues:"`) so each call site reproduces its
exact prior output — guaranteeing zero behavior change — rather than flattening four call
sites onto one hard-coded string. "Looks identical in a review" is **not** "is identical";
only a literal diff of the bodies proves it.

#### Placement decision

Put the helper as a **module-level function in the EXISTING `_review_utils.py`** (which
already houses the reviewer-trio dedup from #599 and already exposes a module `logger`) —
not a new leaf module, and not a base-class method. **Lesson:** prefer an existing
established-dedup home that already fits the architecture boundary (automation-layer helper,
no upward library import) over creating a new module. A `TYPE_CHECKING`-only import of
`WorkerResult` keeps the helper light (the plan confirmed via `models.py:110-133` that the
helper only needs `.success` and `.error`).

#### Most-uncertain assumptions (recorded honestly as risks — this is a PLAN)

These were relied on WITHOUT full verification during planning and must be checked before/during implementation:

- Assumed each of the 4 worker files already has a `from ._review_utils import (...)` group
  to extend — `_review_utils.py` was confirmed to exist and to be imported by reviewers, but
  the exact import-statement shape in each of the 4 files was **not** opened/confirmed.
- Assumed no unit test asserts on `_print_summary` output or logger name (a `tests/` grep for
  `_print_summary` returned only unrelated validation tests) — **the suites were not run**.
- Assumed emitting through `_review_utils`'s `logger` (record `name` =
  `hephaestus.automation._review_utils`) instead of each class's own logger causes no
  regression. No test asserts logger name, but this is an **unverified behavioral change** to
  the log record's `name` field.
- The "~100 lines removed" figure is the issue's number; the actual removal is **~70 lines**
  (4 methods), since 2 of the 6 are out of scope.

### Phase 14: Planning a behavior-preserving method→free-function extraction when the method is a patched test seam (NEW in v1.9.0, PLANNING-ONLY)

> **Warning:** This phase is a **proposed workflow** captured from PLANNING ProjectHephaestus
> issue #1383. It was **NOT validated end-to-end** — no code was written, no tests were run,
> and no CI confirmed it. Treat every step below as a hypothesis until CI confirms it on a
> real PR. The rest of this skill is `verified-ci`; this phase alone is unverified.

The #1383 plan extracts a duplicated `_load_impl_session_id` method (present on both `CIDriver`
and `AddressReviewer`) into a shared free function
`load_impl_session_id(state_dir, issue_number, agent)` in
`hephaestus/automation/_review_utils.py`, with both classes delegating to it. The durable
lessons below are about **planning** such an extraction safely, not the mechanics of writing it.
(Sibling to Phase 13: that phase is about stale *count* claims; this one is about preserving a
*patched test seam* and separating behavior-bearing from incidental method differences.)

#### 14a. Patch-by-name test seams force you to KEEP the method, not delete it

When a duplicated method is patched via `patch.object(obj, "_method", ...)` at many call sites,
deleting it during extraction breaks **every** patch target. In #1383 the method was patched at
`test_ci_driver.py:789,830,848,884,2344,2358` and `test_address_review.py:680,714`. The correct
move is to keep each method as a **one-line thin wrapper** that delegates to the new free
function, preserving the seam:

```python
class CIDriver:
    def _load_impl_session_id(self, issue_number: int, agent: str) -> str | None:
        # Thin wrapper preserves the patch.object(...) test seam; logic lives in the free fn.
        return load_impl_session_id(self.state_dir, issue_number, agent)
```

**Grep for `patch.object(.*"_method_name"` BEFORE planning the deletion.** This is the single
most uncertain, highest-leverage assumption in such a plan — if any test patches the method by
name, deletion is off the table.

#### 14b. "Near-identical" methods usually differ in non-asserted ways — verify the test contract before collapsing

The two #1383 copies were *not* byte-for-byte identical: they differed in the **log level** on
the no-file branch (`logger.debug` vs `logger.warning`), one had an extra truncated-session debug
line, and the exception-message wording differed. The plan chose to collapse to **one** logging
style in the shared helper. That is only safe because **no unit test asserts log level or
message** — verified by reading the actual test bodies (`test_ci_driver.py:126-132`,
`test_address_review.py:103-111` assert only the `None` return value).

**Lesson:** when consolidating "near-identical" code, *the differences are the risk*. Read the
tests to confirm which differences are behavior-bearing vs incidental, and state explicitly in
the plan what you collapsed and why it is safe.

#### 14c. Reuse the target module's established convention

`_review_utils.py` already houses cross-reviewer helpers as **free functions taking explicit
args** (`find_pr_for_issue`, `instance_log`, `parse_json_block`). Matching that convention (a
free function, not a new mixin or base-class method) is lower-risk than introducing a new sharing
mechanism. **Grep the target module's existing helpers before choosing the extraction shape** —
the module already tells you the idiom.

#### 14d. Hedge the unverified external assumptions a planner did not execute

A planning-only plan must flag the assumptions it relied on **without running anything**, so the
reviewer/implementer double-checks them:

- **Imports:** `_review_utils.py` may not already import `pathlib.Path` — say "add if not
  present" rather than asserting it exists.
- **Existing import lines:** both `ci_driver.py` and `address_review.py` are assumed to already
  have a `from ._review_utils import ...` line to extend — say "verify and extend, else add".
- **Cross-layer import safety:** the helper uses `session_agent_matches` from
  `hephaestus.agents.runtime`. `_review_utils.py` is in the **automation** layer, so importing
  from the **library** (`hephaestus.agents.runtime`) is the *allowed* direction
  (automation → library). Confirm it does not create a circular import.
- **Import-surface boundary:** `test_import_surface.py` / `test_automation_boundary.py` enforce
  that base `import hephaestus` stays clean. Adding a runtime import to an automation-layer module
  is fine, but the planner must confirm the new helper is **not** pulled into the base import
  surface.

#### 14e. Verification-by-criterion for a pure extraction

Prove the two acceptance criteria explicitly:

- **Single canonical source** — a grep that must return exactly **one** hit:

  ```bash
  grep -rn 'state_dir / f"issue-{issue_number}.json"' hephaestus/automation/   # expect: 1
  ```

- **Zero behavioral change** — run the **PRE-EXISTING per-class test suites unchanged**
  (`test_ci_driver.py`, `test_address_review.py`), not just the new helper tests. The real
  acceptance gate for a behavior-preserving refactor is the EXISTING behavioral tests staying
  green; new structural tests for the free function are necessary but insufficient.

### Phase 15: Planning a duplicate-bearing standalone script → library-shim consolidation with output-contract preservation (NEW in v1.10.0, PLANNING-ONLY)

> no CI confirmed it. Treat every step below as a hypothesis until CI confirms it on a real PR.

The #1504 plan targets `scripts/check_unit_test_structure.py`, which **duplicates**
`get_subpackages()` + the subpackage-mirror logic that already lives canonically in the library at
`hephaestus/validation/test_structure.py`. The script's **only unique** function is
`check_scripts_coverage()`. The durable lessons below are about **planning** this kind of
"shim the script to the library" DRY consolidation, not the mechanics of writing it. (Sibling to
Phases 13/14: those preserve a *patched test seam* and a *stale duplicate count*; this one preserves
an *stdout/stderr output contract* and disposes of a *duplicate-bearing script with one unique
function*.)

#### 15a. "Shim vs delete" disposition for a duplicate-bearing script with one unique function

When a standalone script duplicates library logic but **also** carries one unique function, prefer:
**move the unique function into the library** (canonical source), then **rewrite the script as a thin
shim** — rather than deleting the script. In #1504 the disposition was: move `check_scripts_coverage`
INTO the library as a new pure function returning `(ok, error_lines)`, export it from
`hephaestus/validation/__init__.py`, and rewrite the script to import `_get_subpackages`,
`check_scripts_coverage`, and `check_test_directory_mirrors` from the library.

**Why shim, not delete:** the script was referenced by **docs** (`scripts/README.md`), a **skill**
(`python-repo-modernization`), AND it is **smoke-tested via auto-discovery**
(`tests/unit/scripts/conftest.py` globs `scripts/*.py`). Deleting it breaks those references and a
documented invocation. The shim keeps the public surface stable (**POLA**) while removing the
duplication (**DRY**). This is a concrete instance of the Phase 8c classification — "true duplicate →
canonical source + delete copies," refined for the case where the copy-bearing file *also* owns
unique behavior worth preserving.

#### 15b. Output-contract preservation is the silent risk in a shim rewrite

The library functions return **data tuples**; the script **prints** its own ERROR/OK lines, including
a literal `→` arrow and exact phrasing. The shim must **REPRODUCE the byte-for-byte stdout/stderr**,
NOT merely call the library. A flat "call the library `main()`" would change the output and break the
smoke test (and any human reader relying on the wording).

Critically, the library's `check_test_structure` ALSO runs **extra checks** (no-loose-files,
no-unsanctioned-dirs) that the script never ran. So the shim must call the **granular** functions
(`check_test_directory_mirrors` + `check_scripts_coverage`), **NOT** the library's `main()` /
`check_test_structure`, or behavior changes (the script would suddenly fail on conditions it never
checked before).

```python
# Shim: delegate to GRANULAR library fns, reproduce the script's exact lines yourself.
from hephaestus.validation import check_scripts_coverage, check_test_directory_mirrors
from hephaestus.validation.test_structure import _get_subpackages  # see 15c for the boundary risk

ok_mirrors, mirror_errors = check_test_directory_mirrors(...)
ok_scripts, script_errors = check_scripts_coverage(...)
for line in mirror_errors + script_errors:
    print(f"ERROR: {line}", file=sys.stderr)   # preserve exact prefix/phrasing/→ arrow
# DO NOT call check_test_structure()/main() — they run no-loose-files/no-unsanctioned-dirs too.
```

#### 15c. Importing a private symbol across the script→library boundary is the reviewer-contentious choice

Importing a private symbol (`_get_subpackages`) from the library into a sibling **product script** is
the **most reviewer-contentious** choice in this plan. It is defensible as "a shim delegating to the
canonical source," but a reviewer may reject the leading-underscore import across the
script/library boundary. **Offer a fallback** so the reviewer has an out: compute the subpackage count
from data already returned by the public functions, rather than importing the private helper. State
both options in the plan and let the reviewer pick.

#### 15d. Record the unverified reliances explicitly (this is a PLAN)

The #1504 plan relied on these **without full verification** — flag each so the reviewer/implementer
re-confirms:

- **(a) The script is NOT wired to CI/pre-commit.** Claimed verified via grep:
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml:158`, `_required.yml:574`, and `test.yml:105` all call the console entry
  `hephaestus-check-test-structure`, **not** the script. The reviewer should re-confirm — if the
  script *were* wired, the output contract becomes a CI gate, not just a smoke test.
- **(b) `scripts/README.md` needs NO edit** because its "Wired into pre-commit" line still describes
  equivalent behavior. This is a **judgment call** a reviewer may flag as now-inaccurate, since after
  the change the *shim* is what's wired (transitively, via the console entry), not the original
  script. Be ready to update the doc if the reviewer disagrees.
- **(c) The `check_scripts_coverage` body was COPIED** from the existing script into a
  `(ok, errors)`-returning shape. The single-quote-vs-double-quote glob-marker check
  (`glob("*.py")` AND `glob('*.py')`) **must be preserved exactly**, or the broken-glob test gives a
  **false pass**. Diff the copied body against the original line-by-line.

#### 15e. TDD inversion gotcha — a test written after copying the body is GREEN-first, not RED

The new library test class for `check_scripts_coverage` is **GREEN-first, not RED** — because the
function body **already exists** (copied verbatim from the script). Writing the test *after* adding the
function means it passes immediately; there is no genuine RED phase. **Note this honestly** so future
planners (and the implementer) don't claim a RED→GREEN cycle they didn't actually perform. If a true
RED is wanted, write the library test (and an assertion on the exact `(ok, error_lines)` contract)
*before* pasting the body.

### Phase 16: Planning logging setup consolidation plus flag-based CLI C901 extraction (NEW in v1.11.0, PLANNING-ONLY)

> **Warning:** This phase is a **proposed workflow** captured from PLANNING ProjectHephaestus
> issue #1404. It was **NOT validated end-to-end** — no code was written, no tests were run, and
> no CI confirmed it. Treat every step below as a hypothesis until CI confirms it on a real PR.
> The rest of this skill is `verified-ci` (except Phases 10, 13, 14, 15, which are also
> planning-only); this phase alone is unverified.

The #1404 plan had two coupled refactors: route direct `logging.basicConfig` callers through
`hephaestus.logging.utils.setup_logging`, and remove two `# noqa: C901` suppressions from
`hephaestus/github/tidy.py` and `hephaestus/github/pr_merge.py` by extracting the current
flag-based CLI control flow into helpers. The durable lesson is reviewer discipline: stale issue
text can be directionally useful, but the plan must be anchored to the current on-disk AST and
argparse shape.

#### 16a. Treat disk state as authoritative when issue text is stale

If the issue says "subcommands" or gives a count like "11+ direct `basicConfig` callers," verify
both claims from the current tree before planning. For #1404, the current parser definitions were
**flag-based**, not subcommand dispatch, and an AST inventory over `hephaestus/`, `scripts/`, and
`tests/` found **9** direct `logging.basicConfig` callers. The reviewer should re-run this inventory
before implementation because the plan's scope depends on the measured population, not the issue
body.

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import ast
from pathlib import Path

roots = [Path("hephaestus"), Path("scripts"), Path("tests")]

for root in roots:
    for path in sorted(root.rglob("*.py")):
        tree = ast.parse(path.read_text(), filename=str(path))
        aliases = {"logging"}
        direct_imports = set()
        for node in ast.walk(tree):
            if isinstance(node, ast.Import):
                for alias in node.names:
                    if alias.name == "logging":
                        aliases.add(alias.asname or alias.name)
            elif isinstance(node, ast.ImportFrom) and node.module == "logging":
                for alias in node.names:
                    if alias.name == "basicConfig":
                        direct_imports.add(alias.asname or alias.name)
            elif isinstance(node, ast.Call):
                func = node.func
                if (
                    isinstance(func, ast.Attribute)
                    and func.attr == "basicConfig"
                    and isinstance(func.value, ast.Name)
                    and func.value.id in aliases
                ) or (isinstance(func, ast.Name) and func.id in direct_imports):
                    print(f"{path}:{node.lineno}")
PY
```

#### 16b. Extend `setup_logging` only with behavior-parity evidence

The riskiest assumption in the plan is that `setup_logging` can accept new `datefmt` and
`log_to_stdout` knobs without changing existing JSON/log handler behavior. A reviewer should require
tests that prove:

- `log_to_stdout=False, log_to_stderr=True` preserves `logging.basicConfig`'s default stderr
  behavior for current stderr callers.
- Existing JSON formatting and existing file-handler behavior are unchanged.
- Every converted caller's previous `format`, `datefmt`, `stream`, and `filename`/file-handler
  behavior is represented in a parity table before code changes.
- Adding a new option does not accidentally install duplicate stream handlers on repeated setup
  calls.

#### 16c. Preserve flag-based CLI semantics; do not invent fake subcommand dispatch

When the current parser is flag-based, extract helpers around the existing branch structure. Do not
rewrite the plan around subcommands just because stale issue text mentions them. For `tidy.py` and
`pr_merge.py`, the safe planning target is "extract helper functions for the current flag-driven
paths," then cover those helpers with behavior-focused tests. The risk is a clean-looking extraction
that silently changes precedence between flags, defaults, prompts, dry-run paths, or error exits.

#### 16d. Reviewer checklist for this combined refactor

Before approving implementation, reviewers should check:

1. **AST inventory is structural and repo-wide.** It catches `import logging as log`,
   `from logging import basicConfig as bc`, and ordinary `logging.basicConfig`; it scans all three
   roots: `hephaestus/`, `scripts/`, and `tests/`.
2. **No fake subcommand dispatch was introduced.** Any new helper names and tests reflect the
   current flag-based parser, not a stale subcommand model.
3. **Stream/datefmt/file parity is explicit per caller.** Every converted caller has a before/after
   row for formatter string, datefmt, stdout/stderr stream, and file handler behavior.
4. **`tidy` and `pr_merge` tests are behavior-focused.** They exercise the extracted flag-control
   helpers enough that removing `# noqa: C901` is a result of real decomposition, not just moving
   branches around until the McCabe score drops.
5. **C901 subtraction-chain estimates are treated as provisional.** The plan can estimate that
   helper extraction will drop below the threshold, but implementation must re-run Ruff after the
   actual extraction because branch interactions often leave more complexity behind than expected.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Place private helper in a sub-package (`_internal/__init__.py`) | Created `hephaestus/_internal/_version_lookup.py` to group private modules | Triggers circular imports when multiple sibling modules try to import from `_internal`, each bringing their own transitive dependencies that refer back to `_internal` | Use **leaf modules** for private helpers: `_version_lookup.py` (no sub-modules). Packages add layers that create circular paths. |
| Guess PyPI distribution name at runtime from `__name__` or import path | Tried `_dist_name = __name__.split(".")[0]` or `__package__.replace("_", "-").title()` | `importlib.metadata` does NOT normalize distribution names. The name must match the literal `[project].name` value from pyproject.toml exactly. Guessing produced `KeyError` or `PackageNotFoundError`. | Store the PyPI distribution name as a module-level constant in the helper. Do not derive it; it is arbitrary and may differ from the import path. Document the dependency: "Update this constant if [project].name changes in pyproject.toml". |
| Place test for `_version_lookup.py` directly under `tests/unit/` | Created `tests/unit/test_version_lookup.py` | Pre-commit hook `test-file-placement` rejected it — `test_*.py` files cannot live directly under `tests/unit/`. They must be in logical sub-directories that mirror the package structure. | Create `tests/unit/version/` sub-directory and place the test there. This enforces test organization and makes it clear which part of the codebase the test covers. |
| Omit the `-S` flag when committing in a sub-agent dispatch | Ran `git commit -m "..."` without `-S` in a sub-agent shell | The pr-policy CI gate validates commit signatures at the GraphQL layer (via GitHub's `/graphql` API). Commits without valid signatures are flagged as `verification.reason: "unsigned"`, which blocks auto-merge even if all other checks pass. | **Always** use `git commit -S` when creating commits that will be pushed to a PR. The pr-policy gate is non-negotiable for ProjectHephaestus and similar repos. Pre-warm GPG by signing a test commit before agent dispatch if needed. |
| Compare version strings across files to assert "single source" | Wrote drift-check that compared `pyproject.toml` version to `__init__.py` version as strings | After hatch-vcs, `pyproject.toml` no longer has a static `[project].version` field — it declares `dynamic = ["version"]`. String comparisons fail because the field doesn't exist. | Validate the **invariant** (hatch-vcs is configured correctly), not string equality. Check: `dynamic = ["version"]` is present, `[tool.hatch.version].source == "vcs"`. See `hatch-vcs-pyproject-auto-versioning-setup.md` skill. |
| Phase-split directory structure without auditing callers | Added `in_progress`/`completed` split but didn't grep for direct path construction | 17 files still used `experiment_dir / tier_id` directly — silent wrong-dir reads post-merge | ALWAYS run the pre-merge bypass-audit grep before merging any directory-structure change |
| `shutil.move` for a baseline file shared across sibling runs | Moved `pipeline_baseline.json` with the first run during promotion | The second run in the same subtest could no longer find the baseline — it had been moved away | Use `shutil.copy2` for files shared across siblings; only `move` the run directory itself |
| Fix only the broken copy of duplicated JSON-extraction logic | Considered copying the brace-matching fix into the one buggy file | Would have created a 4th duplicate; future bugs need fixing in 4 places | When a bug surfaces duplication, deduplicate to a shared utility FIRST, then the fix lives in one place |
| Plain `"""` docstring containing backslash examples (`\n`) | Wrote extraction-utility docstring with literal backslashes | ruff `D301` failed: "Use r\"\"\" if any backslashes in a docstring" | Use `r"""` for any docstring containing backslashes, even in examples |
| Make `Field(...)` required for an optional-by-usage Pydantic field | Marked `duration_seconds` required in the consolidated base model | Broke existing callers that constructed the object without it | Provide `Field(default=X)` for fields not universally supplied by all callers |
| Mutate a frozen Pydantic model directly | `info.started_at = value` on a `frozen=True` model | Raised `FrozenInstanceError` | Use `model_copy(update={...})` for all field updates on frozen models |
| Rename a class globally without a backward-compat alias | One-pass global rename | Broke external consumers importing the old name | Add `OldName = NewName` alias; old imports keep working |
| Grep only source files for references before deleting/relocating | `--include="*.py"` only | Missed references in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, `scripts/*.py`, `*.yaml` | Grep ALL file types (`.py`, `.mojo`, `.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml`) and use `git rm` to preserve history |
| Leave the same dict structure built in multiple call sites | Kept identical dict construction in a format function and `main()` | Shapes drift independently when new fields are added later | Extract a `_serializable_*()` helper; add a regression test pinning shape parity |
| Lift a mutating closure into a standalone method unchanged | Cut a `nonlocal`-mutating inner function out into a module-level helper as-is | The captured variable became a plain local in the new scope; the caller's value was never updated | Wrap the mutated state in a small mutable box (one-field dataclass or single-element `list` cell) and pass it into the extracted helper |
| Mock a value behind an `@lru_cache` helper without clearing the cache | `unittest.mock.patch` / `monkeypatch.setattr` on the underlying function, then called the cached helper | The cache held the pre-patch value, so the mock was never exercised and the test asserted stale data | Call `helper.cache_clear()` in the test before (and between) patches — ideally via setup/teardown or an autouse fixture |
| Delete a stale script before checking for callers | `git rm old_entrypoint.py` as part of consolidation without grepping first | A kept file still imported / documented it → broken import and dangling doc reference post-merge | Grep all file types for callers FIRST; if a kept file back-references the target, rewrite it self-contained and verify before deleting |
| Keep a hardcoded file list after consolidating the tree | Left `SKILL_FILES = [...]` enumerating discovered files by hand | The list silently rotted as files were added/removed — discovery missed new files and pointed at deleted ones | Discover dynamically with `sorted(Path(...).rglob("*.ext"))` and filter excludes explicitly instead of maintaining an allowlist |
| (PLANNING #1205) Assume two duplicate-*looking* constant lists are pure duplicates and flat-merge them | Planned a single shared frozenset for `TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS` + `NETWORK_ERROR_KEYWORDS` | The resilience layer's documented contract DELIBERATELY omits `"rate limit"`/`"throttle"` ("rate limit error passthrough — not retried"). A flat merge would make it retry rate-limit errors (contract violation) OR drop them from the network tagger (breaks an existing test) | CLASSIFY first: true-duplicate vs intentional-variant-WITH-overlap. For overlap, extract only the shared CORE into one frozenset and have each consumer compose `CORE \| its-own-extras`. Confirm the "intentional" difference is a real, current contract (docstring + test), not stale drift, before scoping the split |
| (PLANNING #1205) Drop exact phrases "because a broad substring in CORE already covers them" | Considered removing `"connection refused"`/`"connection reset"` from the resilience extras since CORE held the broader `"connection"` | `"connection"` MATCHES `"connection refused"` at runtime, but the resilience test `test_essential_patterns_present` asserts EXACT MEMBERSHIP of the phrase `"connection refused"` — matching-equivalence is NOT membership-equivalence. Dropping the phrase passes behavior but fails the membership assertion | Keep the exact phrases as explicit per-consumer extras even when a broad CORE substring would match them. A flat dedupe that elides "covered" phrases silently breaks membership tests |
| (PLANNING #1205) Change a list literal to `sorted(frozenset \| frozenset)` without checking how callers use it | Planned to recompose `TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS`/`NETWORK_ERROR_KEYWORDS` as `sorted(CORE \| extras)` | That changes element ORDER and the source TYPE. Any caller relying on original ordering, on `.append()`/mutation, or on index access would break; and the looser `is_network_error` substrings (`"connection"`,`"timeout"`,`"network"`) must not be accidentally tightened/loosened | Before recomposing, grep callers to confirm ONLY iteration is used (no mutation, no indexing, no order dependence). Keep public names + iterable types; treat each behavioral matcher suite (`test_retry.py`, `test_subprocess_resilience.py`) as the real acceptance gate, not the new constant tests |
| Replacing repeated validation wrappers directly with one module-specific helper | Considered importing one validation module's `_required_*` helpers into the others | Each validation module has its own exception class and message wording; sharing a wrapper would leak the wrong exception/message contract | Share only the primitive type checks and keep local wrappers that pass `error_type` plus exact message text |
| Forcing all fake route apps into one route dictionary shape | A single fake app abstraction looked attractive for all server route tests | Tests intentionally index registered routes differently: by rule, by ordered list, by `(rule, method)`, or by `(method, rule)` | Share the decorator mechanics in a base helper, then keep explicit small storage adapters so test assertions remain clear |
| Reusing a merged feature branch for a follow-up cleanup PR | Current branch already had a merged PR, so committing on it would have produced a confusing branch/PR relationship | GitHub reported the branch's prior PR as `MERGED`; a new PR needed a new branch from current trunk | Stash uncommitted work, fetch current trunk, create a fresh branch from `origin/<trunk>`, pop the stash, re-verify, sign, push, and open the new PR |
| Trusting the issue body's "Evidence:" file list for a dedup scope | Assumed 4 files had `_sign()` per the issue; started planning a 4-file refactor | Prior PRs had partially resolved the issue — 3 of the 4 files had already migrated to the canonical `sign_body()`. Only 1 file had the wrapper remaining | **Grep first.** `grep -rn "def _sign"` shows current truth; the issue Evidence section reflects creation-time state, not current HEAD. |
| Added a pytest fixture to conftest.py for a pure `bytes→str` HMAC helper | Wrapped `sign_body(body, INTEGRATION_TEST_SECRET)` as a pytest fixture so tests could receive it via DI | Introduced unnecessary indirection — the helper takes two args, one of which is a module-local constant, making the fixture callers less readable than just calling the function directly | For a pure `bytes→str` function closing over a local constant, **inline** the call (`sign_body(body_bytes, LOCAL_SECRET)`) at each call site; save fixtures for stateful or async setup |
| Rebased onto the diverged remote branch that had a competing solution | `git pull origin 329-auto-impl` triggered a rebase with 84 commits and multiple conflicts | The remote had taken a different architectural approach; rebasing imported 84 unrelated commits and produced conflicts at every differing point | `git rebase --abort`; create a fresh local branch from current state; push as a new branch; open a new PR. The remote's competing solution becomes a sibling PR for maintainer review — don't overwrite it |
| (PLANNING #1381) Trust the issue's duplicate COUNT and "byte-for-byte identical" claim | Issue stated "6 nearly-identical `_print_summary` methods, 5 byte-for-byte identical"; planned a 6-method extraction removing ~100 lines | Stale. Only 4 were true duplicates: `IssueImplementer` had already been refactored to delegate to a richer `ImplementationSummaryPrinter`; `Planner` had a different signature and operated on a different model (`PlanResult` vs `WorkerResult`). Real scope was 4 methods / ~70 lines | The duplicate COUNT and "byte-for-byte identical" assertion go stale exactly like the "Evidence:" section (extends Phase 12a). DIFF every claimed-duplicate body in full before scoping — don't trust the count |
| (PLANNING #1381) Flat-merge the 4 "identical" methods into one hard-coded helper | The 4 bodies looked identical in review, so a single helper with fixed strings seemed safe | Two real behavioral diffs would have been silently changed: (a) one logged `"Total PRs:"` vs the others' `"Total issues:"`; (b) two used a leading-newline `"\nFailed issues:"` header, two did not | "Looks identical in review" != "is identical." Parameterize call-site-varying string args as kwargs-with-defaults (`count_noun=`, `failed_header=`) to guarantee zero behavior change — an application of Phase 8c classify-before-merge to a shared function's varying string args |
| (PLANNING #1381) Put the new helper in a new leaf module or a base-class method | Considered a fresh `_summary_printing.py` module or a mixin/base-class `_print_summary` | A new module/base class adds a layer when an established-dedup home already fits the boundary; `_review_utils.py` already houses reviewer-trio dedup (#599) and a module `logger`, and is an automation-layer helper with no upward library import | Prefer an EXISTING established-dedup module that already fits the architecture boundary over creating a new leaf module or base-class method |
| (PLANNING #1383) Delete the duplicated method after extracting it to a free function | Planned to remove `_load_impl_session_id` from both `CIDriver` and `AddressReviewer` once `load_impl_session_id` existed | The method is a **patched test seam** — `patch.object(obj, "_load_impl_session_id", ...)` at `test_ci_driver.py:789,830,848,884,2344,2358` and `test_address_review.py:680,714`. Deleting it breaks every patch target | Grep `patch.object(.*"_method"` BEFORE planning deletion. Keep each method as a one-line thin wrapper delegating to the new free function so the seam survives |
| (PLANNING #1383) Collapse two "near-identical" methods' logging without checking the tests | The copies differed in log level (`logger.debug` vs `logger.warning`), an extra truncated-session debug line, and exception wording; plan collapsed to one logging style | "Near-identical" hides behavior-bearing diffs; collapsing logging is only safe if no test asserts log level/message | Read the actual test bodies (`test_ci_driver.py:126-132`, `test_address_review.py:103-111` assert only the `None` return) to confirm which diffs are incidental; state explicitly in the plan what you collapsed and why it's safe |
| (PLANNING #1383) Invent a new sharing mechanism for the shared helper | Considered a mixin / base class for `load_impl_session_id` | The target module `_review_utils.py` already houses cross-reviewer helpers as free functions with explicit args (`find_pr_for_issue`, `instance_log`, `parse_json_block`); a new mechanism is higher-risk | Grep the target module's existing helpers and match its established convention (free function, explicit args) rather than introducing a mixin/base-class method |
| (PLANNING #1383) Assert un-run imports/boundary facts as true in the plan | Wrote "Path is imported", "the `from ._review_utils import ...` line exists", "no boundary violation" without executing | A planning-only plan ran nothing; stating unverified facts as certain misleads the implementer/reviewer | Hedge: "add `pathlib.Path` if not present"; "verify-and-extend the existing import line, else add"; confirm the automation→library import (`hephaestus.agents.runtime`) is the allowed direction with no cycle and that the new helper stays out of the base `import hephaestus` surface (`test_import_surface.py` / `test_automation_boundary.py`) |
| (PLANNING #1383) Accept new structural helper tests alone as proof of a behavior-preserving refactor | Planned to add tests for `load_impl_session_id` and call the refactor done | New structural tests prove the helper exists, not that behavior is unchanged | The real acceptance gate is the PRE-EXISTING per-class suites (`test_ci_driver.py`, `test_address_review.py`) staying green, plus a single-canonical-source grep that returns exactly one hit (`grep -rn 'state_dir / f"issue-{issue_number}.json"' hephaestus/automation/`) |
| (PLANNING #1504) Delete the duplicate-bearing script instead of shimming it | Considered `git rm scripts/check_unit_test_structure.py` since its mirror logic duplicates the library | The script is referenced by `scripts/README.md`, the `python-repo-modernization` skill, AND smoke-tested via auto-discovery (`tests/unit/scripts/conftest.py` globs `scripts/*.py`); deletion breaks those references and a documented invocation | When a duplicate-bearing script ALSO owns one unique function, SHIM not DELETE: move the unique fn into the library as canonical, rewrite the script as a thin shim. Keeps the public surface stable (POLA) while removing duplication (DRY) |
| (PLANNING #1504) Make the shim call the library's `main()`/`check_test_structure` | Looked simplest to delegate the whole script to one library entry point | `check_test_structure` ALSO runs no-loose-files / no-unsanctioned-dirs checks the script NEVER ran — the shim would suddenly fail on conditions outside its contract — and the library returns data tuples while the script prints its own ERROR/OK lines (literal `→` arrow, exact phrasing) | Call the GRANULAR functions (`check_test_directory_mirrors` + `check_scripts_coverage`) and REPRODUCE the byte-for-byte stdout/stderr in the shim; do not route through `main()`/`check_test_structure` |
| (PLANNING #1504) Import the private `_get_subpackages` from the library without a fallback | Planned `from hephaestus.validation.test_structure import _get_subpackages` in the product script | A leading-underscore import across the script→library boundary is the most reviewer-contentious choice; a reviewer may reject it outright | Offer a fallback (compute the subpackage count from data the PUBLIC functions already return) and present both options so the reviewer has an out |
| (PLANNING #1504) Claim a RED→GREEN TDD cycle for the new library test | The plan added a test class for `check_scripts_coverage` after copying its body into the library | The function body already existed (copied verbatim from the script), so the test passes immediately — it is GREEN-first, there was no genuine RED phase | Note the inversion honestly; if a real RED is wanted, write the library test + exact `(ok, error_lines)` contract assertion BEFORE pasting the body |
| (PLANNING #1504) Assume `scripts/README.md` and the not-wired-to-CI claim need no re-check | Plan asserted the script is not in CI/pre-commit (only `hephaestus-check-test-structure` is wired) and the README line stays accurate | These were grep-claimed but un-run reliances; once the shim is what's transitively wired, the README "Wired into pre-commit" line may read as inaccurate, and a CI-wired script would make the output contract a gate not a smoke test | Record un-run reliances as explicit RISKS for the reviewer: re-confirm the script is not CI/pre-commit-wired, re-judge the README accuracy, and diff the copied glob-marker check (`glob("*.py")` AND `glob('*.py')`) line-by-line or the broken-glob test gives a false pass |
| (PLANNING #1404) Trust the issue body's caller count and parser shape | Issue text apparently mentioned subcommands and 11+ direct `logging.basicConfig` callers | Current disk state differed: parser definitions were flag-based and AST discovery over `hephaestus/`, `scripts/`, and `tests/` found 9 direct callers | Treat issue text as a hint. Re-run structural AST inventory and read parser definitions before implementation; scope the plan from disk reality |
| (PLANNING #1404) Extend `setup_logging` without proving handler parity | Planned to add `datefmt` and `log_to_stdout` so direct `basicConfig` callers can route through `setup_logging` | This assumes existing JSON formatter behavior, file handlers, duplicate-handler behavior, and default stderr behavior remain unchanged | Require per-caller parity rows and tests for stderr/stdout, `datefmt`, JSON formatting, and file handlers before converting callers |
| (PLANNING #1404) Rewrite flag-based CLIs as if they had subcommands | A stale issue phrase could lead the plan toward subcommand-style dispatch helpers | Introducing fake subcommand dispatch changes the mental model and may alter flag precedence/default paths | Extract helpers around the current flag-based control flow; tests should name and exercise flag paths, not invented subcommands |
| (PLANNING #1404) Treat C901 subtraction estimates as proof | Estimated that extracting helper functions from `tidy.py` and `pr_merge.py` would remove two C901 suppressions | McCabe complexity only proves out after the actual branch structure is extracted; small leftover conditionals can keep C901 above threshold | Re-run Ruff after implementation and keep behavior-focused helper tests for the original CLI paths before removing `# noqa: C901` |

### Code Changes

**Files Modified**: 2

- `scylla/e2e/runner.py` - Implementation
- `tests/unit/e2e/test_runner.py` - Tests

**Lines Changed**: +173 / -18

### Test Coverage

**New Tests**: 4 unit tests

- `test_empty_tier_results()` - Empty dict handling
- `test_single_tier_result()` - Single item aggregation
- `test_multiple_tier_results()` - Multi-item aggregation
- `test_zero_token_stats()` - Zero value handling

**Regression Tests**: 467 E2E tests passed

### Helper Method Pattern

```python
def _aggregate_token_stats(self, tier_results: dict[TierID, TierResult]) -> TokenStats:
    """Aggregate token statistics from all tier results.

    Args:
        tier_results: Dictionary mapping tier IDs to their results

    Returns:
        Aggregated token statistics across all tiers. Returns empty
        TokenStats if tier_results is empty.
    """
    from functools import reduce

    if not tier_results:
        return TokenStats()

    return reduce(
        lambda a, b: a + b,
        [t.token_stats for t in tier_results.values()],
        TokenStats(),
    )
```

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Import placement**: `from functools import reduce` inside method
2. **Empty handling**: Explicit check with early return
3. **Identity element**: Empty `TokenStats()` as third parameter to `reduce`
4. **Type hints**: Complete signature with proper types
5. **Docstring**: Clear description with Args and Returns sections

## Version History

- **v1.11.0** (2026-06-27, **planning-only for the new phase / unverified**): Added Phase 16 — planning a direct `logging.basicConfig` → `hephaestus.logging.utils.setup_logging` consolidation plus flag-based CLI helper extraction to remove C901 suppressions, captured from ProjectHephaestus #1404. Key lessons: (16a) treat disk state as authoritative when stale issue text claims subcommands or 11+ callers; re-run a structural AST inventory over `hephaestus/`, `scripts/`, and `tests/` (including logging aliases) because the plan found 9 direct callers and current parsers were flag-based; (16b) extending `setup_logging` with `datefmt` and `log_to_stdout` is risky until tests prove stderr/stdout, JSON formatter, file-handler, and duplicate-handler parity; (16c) extract helpers around the existing flag-based `tidy.py`/`pr_merge.py` control flow, not invented subcommand dispatch; (16d) treat C901 subtraction-chain estimates as provisional until Ruff runs on the actual extraction. Added 4 Failed Attempts rows, a planning inventory template, a Verified On entry, trigger phrases, and tags. Bumped frontmatter `version` to 1.11.0, `date` to 2026-06-27, and kept `verification: unverified`. NOT executed end-to-end (no code, no tests, no CI). Prior v1.10.0 snapshot archived to history.
- **v1.10.0** (2026-06-26, **planning-only for the new phase / unverified**): Added Phase 15 — planning a duplicate-bearing standalone script → library-shim consolidation with output-contract preservation, captured from ProjectHephaestus #1504 (`scripts/check_unit_test_structure.py` duplicates `get_subpackages()`/subpackage-mirror logic in `hephaestus/validation/test_structure.py` but uniquely owns `check_scripts_coverage()`). Five sub-sections: (15a) SHIM over DELETE — move the unique function into the library as canonical `(ok, error_lines)`, export from `hephaestus/validation/__init__.py`, rewrite the script as a thin shim, because the script is referenced by `scripts/README.md`, the `python-repo-modernization` skill, and auto-discovery smoke tests (`tests/unit/scripts/conftest.py`); (15b) output-contract preservation — reproduce byte-for-byte stdout/stderr (literal `→` arrow, exact phrasing) by calling the GRANULAR functions (`check_test_directory_mirrors` + `check_scripts_coverage`), NOT `main()`/`check_test_structure` which run extra no-loose-files/no-unsanctioned-dirs checks the script never ran; (15c) the private `_get_subpackages` import across the script→library boundary is the reviewer-contentious choice — offer a data-derived fallback; (15d) record un-run reliances as explicit risks (not-CI/pre-commit-wired claim, README accuracy judgment call, exact single-vs-double-quote glob-marker check copied verbatim); (15e) TDD GREEN-first inversion — a library test written after copying the body is not RED, don't claim a cycle you didn't have. Added 5 Failed Attempts rows, a Verified On entry, trigger phrases, and tags. Bumped frontmatter `version` to 1.10.0, `date` to 2026-06-26, and `verification` to `unverified`. NOT executed end-to-end (no code, no tests, no CI). Sibling to the planning-only Phases 10/13/14. Prior v1.9.0 snapshot archived to history.
- **v1.9.0** (2026-06-20, **planning-only for the new phase / unverified**): Added Phase 14 — planning a behavior-preserving method→free-function extraction when the duplicated method is a patched test seam, captured from ProjectHephaestus #1383 (extract `_load_impl_session_id` → `load_impl_session_id(state_dir, issue_number, agent)` in `hephaestus/automation/_review_utils.py`). Five sub-sections: (14a) grep `patch.object` before deletion — keep each method as a thin wrapper to preserve the seam; (14b) read tests to separate behavior-bearing diffs (log level/message) from incidental ones before collapsing "near-identical" copies; (14c) match the target module's free-function convention rather than a mixin/base class; (14d) hedge unverified import/boundary assumptions (Path import, existing import line, automation→library direction, base-import-surface cleanliness); (14e) prove a pure extraction via a single-hit canonical grep + EXISTING per-class behavioral suites staying green. Added 5 Failed Attempts rows, a Verified On entry, new trigger phrases, and tags. NOT executed end-to-end (no code, no tests, no CI). The rest of the skill stays `verified-ci`; Phase 14 carries its own unverified warning. Sibling to the #1381 Phase 13 (stale-count) added the same day. Prior v1.8.0 snapshot archived to history.
- **v1.8.0** (2026-06-20, **planning-only / unverified**): Added Phase 13 — stale "N identical duplicates" claims in extraction issues. Captured from PLANNING ProjectHephaestus issue #1381 ("Extract shared `print_worker_summary` helper"); NOT executed end-to-end (no code, no tests, no CI). Lessons: (1) an issue's duplicate COUNT and "byte-for-byte identical" assertion go stale exactly like its "Evidence:" section (extends Phase 12a) — an issue claiming "6 methods, 5 byte-for-byte identical" had only 4 true duplicates (one already delegated to a richer `ImplementationSummaryPrinter`, one with a different signature/model `PlanResult` vs `WorkerResult`); count and DIFF every claimed-duplicate body before scoping. (2) Even the 4 "identical" bodies hid two call-site-varying literals (`"Total PRs:"` vs `"Total issues:"`; leading-newline `"\nFailed issues:"` header vs none) — parameterize as kwargs-with-defaults (`count_noun=`, `failed_header=`) to guarantee zero behavior change, an application of Phase 8c classify-before-merge to a shared function's string args. (3) Placement: prefer an EXISTING established-dedup module (`_review_utils.py`, already houses #599 reviewer-trio dedup + a module `logger`) over a new leaf module or base-class method. Added 3 Failed Attempts rows and a Verified On row. Recorded most-uncertain planning assumptions as explicit risks. Prior v1.7.0 snapshot archived to history.
- **v1.7.0** (2026-06-19): Added Phase 12 — three concrete lessons from ProjectHermes #329 (HMAC `_sign()` dedup): (1) grep the CURRENT state before trusting issue body "Evidence:" sections (prior PRs may have partially resolved it); (2) inline a pure `bytes→str` helper over adding a pytest fixture or conftest entry when the function closes over a module-local constant; (3) when a remote branch has diverged with a competing solution, push as a new branch rather than force-pushing or rebasing 84 conflicting commits. Added 3 Failed Attempts rows. Updated Verified On table. Verification: verified-ci via ProjectHermes PR #652. Prior v1.6.0 snapshot archived to history.
- **v1.6.0** (2026-06-18): Added Phase 11, a locally verified Radiance behavior-preserving duplicate cleanup workflow. Captures shared server route test fakes, parameterized layout-only metric kernels via `LayoutReindexKernel`, shared primitive validation field checks with local wrappers preserving exception/message contracts, stale script deletion after caller audit, and the fresh-branch PR workflow when the current branch's old PR is already merged. Verification was local/pre-push only; PR #908 CI was pending at capture time. Prior v1.5.0 snapshot archived to history.
- **v1.5.0** (2026-06-12): Added Phase 10 (PLANNING-ONLY, **unverified**) — the core/extras split for consolidating OVERLAPPING constant collections that are intentional-variants-with-overlap, not pure duplicates. Refines the Phase 8c classification table with a third middle path: extract only the shared CORE into one immutable frozenset, compose each consumer as `CORE | extras`, and prove anti-drift with `CORE.issubset(consumer)` parity tests while keeping public names/types. Added 3 Failed Attempts rows (flat-merge-violates-contract, drop-phrases-because-broad-substring-covers-them, recompose-changes-order/type) and a `## Verified On` table. Captured from planning ProjectHephaestus issue #1205; NOT executed end-to-end (no code, no tests, no CI). Prior v1.4.0 snapshot archived to history.
- **v1.4.0** (2026-06-07): Restored SRP/LRU-cache/stale-script DRY patterns lost in the v1.3.0 absorption (nuance audit). Added Phase 9 + `### Detailed Steps`: extract-method/SRP decomposition with mutable-box closure conversion, `@lru_cache` detection util with the `mock.patch`/`cache_clear()` gotcha, stale-script/deprecated-stub cleanup (grep callers first, rewrite back-references self-contained), and dynamic `Path.rglob` discovery. Added 4 Failed Attempts rows.
- **v1.3.0** (2026-06-07): Absorbed 5 skills — `centralized-path-constants`, `private-module-extraction-helper-pattern`, `deduplicate-llm-json-extraction`, `dry-consolidation-workflow`, `dry-consolidate-to-canonical-refactor`. Added Quick Reference h3 and Phase 8 (path constants, LLM JSON dedup, discovery/classify pass, Pydantic type hierarchy, dict-structure consolidation, orphan relocation). Extended description and Failed Attempts. Full originals preserved in history.
- **v1.1.0** (2026-06-04): Added Phase 7 covering private module extraction patterns, test structure mirroring enforcement, cryptographic commit signing, PyPI distribution name handling. Verified via ProjectHephaestus issue #739.
- **v1.0.0** (2026-02-15): Initial release covering token aggregation extraction with TDD workflow.
