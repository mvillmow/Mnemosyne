# Git DCO Signed-off-by Is Distinct from GPG Signing

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-26 |
| **Objective** | Land 5 stranded auto-impl refactor PRs whose `required-checks-gate` was red because `pr-policy` Check 4 (DCO Signed-off-by trailer) failed independently of GPG signing |
| **Outcome** | Successful — added the `Signed-off-by` trailer to every commit (including bot-authored ones) while preserving GPG signatures; pr-policy and required-checks-gate went green |
| **Verification** | verified-ci — these commits actually merged in ProjectHephaestus on 2026-06-26 via this fix |

## When to Use

- A PR is BLOCKED and the `pr-policy` / `required-checks-gate` CI gate fails with `missing Signed-off-by: Name <email> trailer` even though `git log --show-signature` shows a valid GPG signature.
- Automation/agent-generated commits (auto-impl branches like #1385, #1392) lack the DCO trailer because the generator ran `git commit -S` without `-s`.
- You need to retroactively add `Signed-off-by` to every commit on a branch WITHOUT losing GPG signatures.
- Lint passes but `required-checks-gate` still fails — inspect the `pr-policy` sub-checks (Check 4 is DCO).
- You fixed only one blocker (mypy/lint) but the gate is still red on a second, independent DCO failure.

## Verified Workflow

The key fact: `git commit -S` (GPG/SSH cryptographic signature, satisfies
`required_signatures` / `verified=true`) is ORTHOGONAL to `git commit -s`
(appends a `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` text trailer, the Developer Certificate
of Origin). `pr-policy` Check 4 requires the TRAILER on every commit; it does
not inspect the GPG signature. A commit can be `%G?`=`G`/`U` (cryptographically
signed) and still fail Check 4 for lack of the trailer.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. ALWAYS commit with BOTH the DCO trailer (-s) and the GPG signature (-S):
git commit -s -S -m "feat(scope): message"

# 2. Retroactively add the DCO trailer to EVERY commit on a branch while
#    PRESERVING GPG signing (works because commit.gpgsign=true):
git rebase --exec "git commit --amend --no-edit -s -S" origin/main
git push --force-with-lease

# 3. Verify per-commit — every commit MUST show a non-empty signoff:
git log origin/main..HEAD \
  --format="%h %s | signoff:[%(trailers:key=Signed-off-by,valueonly)] gpg:%G?"

# 4. Find WHICH pr-policy sub-check failed (the gate aggregates):
gh run view --job <id> --log   # grep for "Check 4: DCO Signed-off-by"
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Diagnose the real blocker.** `required-checks-gate` aggregates several
   checks; a red gate is often a downstream consequence of `pr-policy`. Open the
   gate's job log with `gh run view --job <id> --log` and find the named
   sub-checks ("Check 3: Conventional Commits", "Check 4: DCO Signed-off-by").
   Enumerate ALL failing sub-checks before re-pushing — do not assume a single
   cause.
2. **Confirm it is DCO, not GPG.** Run `git log --show-signature -1` — if it
   shows a valid signature but the gate still fails on `missing Signed-off-by`,
   the problem is the missing text trailer, a separate requirement.
3. **Add the trailer to every commit.** Run
   `git rebase --exec "git commit --amend --no-edit -s -S" origin/main`. The
   `-s` appends the trailer; `-S` re-applies the GPG signature so the rebase
   does not strip it. This covers EVERY commit on the branch, including
   bot/automation-authored ones — Check 4 validates all of them, not just HEAD.
4. **Verify.** Run the per-commit verify command above; every line must show a
   non-empty `signoff:[...]`. A `gpg:U` (signed but locally-untrusted key) is
   FINE — GitHub verifies server-side, and both `U` and `G` satisfy
   crypto-signing.
5. **Push.** `git push --force-with-lease` (safer than `--force`).

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Committed with `git commit -S` only (no -s) | Assumed GPG signing satisfied the policy | pr-policy Check 4 failed: missing Signed-off-by trailer; required-checks-gate then failed downstream | DCO trailer is a separate text requirement from crypto signing — always pass both -s and -S |
| Fixed the mypy/lint error and assumed the gate would pass | Treated required-checks-gate as a single-cause failure | Gate still red — a second independent DCO failure remained | A required-checks-gate failure can aggregate multiple independent causes; enumerate ALL failing pr-policy sub-checks before re-pushing |
| Re-signed only the new commit, left the original auto-impl commit untouched | Thought only my own commit needed the trailer | Check 4 validates EVERY commit on the PR, including bot/automation-authored ones | Use `git rebase --exec ... -s -S origin/main` to cover every commit, not just HEAD |

## Results & Parameters

- **Repo**: `HomericIntelligence/ProjectHephaestus`
- **Gate**: `pr-policy` (required), with sub-check script `check_dco_signoff.py`
  (Check 4). `required-checks-gate` aggregates it and shows red downstream.
- **Context**: Landing 5 stranded auto-impl refactor PRs; PR #1615's
  required-checks-gate failed on both lint(mypy) AND DCO. Multiple auto-impl
  branches (#1385, #1392) had the same DCO gap.
- **Always-commit recipe** (copy-paste):

  ```bash
  git commit -s -S -m "feat(scope): message"
  ```

- **Retroactive fix-all recipe** (copy-paste):

  ```bash
  git rebase --exec "git commit --amend --no-edit -s -S" origin/main
  git push --force-with-lease
  ```

- **Verify recipe** (copy-paste):

  ```bash
  git log origin/main..HEAD \
    --format="%h %s | signoff:[%(trailers:key=Signed-off-by,valueonly)] gpg:%G?"
  ```

- **Interpreting `%G?`**: `G` = good signature, `U` = signed but
  locally-untrusted key (FINE — GitHub verifies server-side). Both satisfy
  crypto-signing; neither implies the DCO trailer is present.
