# Git Worktree Parallel Execution Lifecycle

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Date** | 2026-05-19 |
| **Objective** | Complete lifecycle of git worktrees for parallel agent execution: creation, switching, syncing, parallel dispatch, contamination recovery, and constraint-aware cleanup |
| **Outcome** | Canonical consolidation of 4 skills: worktree-parallel-agent-execution (v1.5.0), worktree-cleanup-user-constraints (v1.6.0), git-worktree-management-patterns (v2.8.0), worktree-lifecycle-create-switch-sync (v1.0.0) |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |
| **History** | [changelog](./git-worktree-parallel-execution-lifecycle.history) |

Covers the full git worktree lifecycle for parallel agent work: creation, navigation, syncing
with upstream, parallel wave execution patterns, branch collision avoidance, contamination
detection and recovery, constraint-aware cleanup, and myrmidon swarm parallelization for
mass cleanup. Includes the critical "no-worktree-at-all" anti-pattern warning.

## When to Use

**Parallel execution:**

- Multiple independent issues (3+): code refactoring, test additions, config changes
- Single multi-part issue with 2+ truly independent remediation items (hot-file split)
- Mass-rebasing many PR branches after a large main merge
- Time-critical sprints where independent tasks can parallelize

**Lifecycle / create / switch / sync:**

- Starting isolated work on a new issue alongside ongoing branches
- Switching between branches without stashing context
- Long-running feature branches that need syncing with main
- Editing a file and getting "nothing to commit" (path confusion)
- Detecting when a `.claude-prompt-<N>.md` task is already done

**Cleanup:**

- User says "no branch deletion" or "give me a script to review first"
- Worktrees from merged branches have uncommitted files that might be real work
- 20+ worktrees after parallel wave execution with mixed states
- Locked worktrees from dead agent PIDs (myrmidon swarm sessions)
- `git worktree remove --force` blocked by Safety Net
- Auditing a worktree-looking directory that may belong to a DIFFERENT repo or a
  clone-within-a-repo (e.g. `build/.worktrees/...`, `build/<OtherProject>`)
- Distinguishing stale-checkout drift (redundant-with-main dirty diff) from real uncommitted work
- A bulk `git reset --hard` / `git clean -fd` / `git worktree remove --force` got safety-net-blocked
- Cleaning worktrees in a repo with git SUBMODULES where `git worktree remove` refuses with
  `fatal: working trees containing submodules cannot be moved or removed` (even when clean)
- Deciding if a merged worktree branch is prunable when `git branch --merged` does not list it
  (squash-merge caveat: trust the PR `MERGED` state, not `--merged`/commits-ahead)
- A dirty worktree whose uncommitted changes are junk (an abandoned partial revert of merged work)
  — inspect + ASK the user rather than auto-commit/auto-discard

**Cross-process subprocess contention:**

- Two parallel SUBPROCESSES (separate `subprocess.run` children, not threads) race on the same
  `build/.worktrees/issue-<N>` path and one dies with `fatal: '.../issue-<N>' already exists`
- Needing a reusable cross-process file lock and discovering only inline `fcntl.flock` copies exist
- An in-process `threading.Lock` "not working" / failing to serialize because the contention is
  across processes, not threads

**Not suitable for:**

- Issues requiring shared state or coordinated changes across the same files
- More than 2 sub-tasks for a single issue (coordination cost dominates)
- EASY-tier 8+ issue swarms (serialize instead — see Phase 0a)

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Create worktree for new issue
git worktree add .worktrees/issue-<N> -b <N>-feature-name origin/main

# Split one issue into 2 parallel sub-tasks
git worktree add ~/<repo>-worktrees/<issue>-a -b <issue>-a main
git worktree add ~/<repo>-worktrees/<issue>-b -b <issue>-b main

# Switch (just cd — no stash needed)
cd <repo>/.worktrees/issue-<N>
git branch --show-current

# Sync with main (from inside worktree)
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main

# Remote collision check BEFORE push (required for parallel agents)
git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <branch> \
  && { echo "FATAL: branch exists on remote — STOP"; exit 1; }
git push -u origin <branch>

# Branch check BEFORE every commit in parallel agent
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git -C <my-worktree-path> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "<my-assigned-branch>" ] \
  && { echo "ABORT: branch contamination detected"; exit 1; }

# Remove single worktree (cd out first)
cd <repo-root>
git worktree remove .worktrees/issue-<N>
git worktree prune

# Inventory all worktrees with state
git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{print $2}' | tail -n +2 | while read wt; do
  br=$(git -C "$wt" branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "(detached)")
  dirty=$(git -C "$wt" status --short 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  cherry=$(git cherry origin/main "$br" 2>/dev/null | grep -c '^+' || echo "?")
  pr=$(gh pr list --head "$br" --state all --json state,number \
    --jq '.[0] | "\(.state) #\(.number)"' 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PR")
  echo "$wt | branch=$br | dirty=$dirty | cherry=$cherry | pr=$pr"
done | tee /tmp/wt-inventory.txt

# Locked worktree cleanup (clean PIDs only)
git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{wt=$2} /^locked/{print wt " LOCKED"}'
git -C <locked-path> status --short   # empty = safe
git worktree unlock <path> && git worktree remove <path>

# Fix stale origin/HEAD
git fetch origin && git remote set-head origin --auto
```

### Phase 0a: Branch-Namespace Contamination (Serialize EASY-Tier)

**Foundation**: ProjectOdyssey Phase G EASY-tier swarm (PR #5363, 2026-05-09). Eight parallel
haiku/sonnet agents dispatched with `Task(isolation="worktree")` committed to the parent
repo's checked-out branch instead of their own assigned worktree branch.

**Root cause**: `Task isolation=worktree` gives path isolation but does NOT isolate the git
index/HEAD when N agents target N distinct branches sharing the parent `.git/`. A parallel
`git commit` from inside a sub-worktree can race the parent HEAD pointer and land on the
wrong branch. `git status` in a sibling agent then shows stat-cache deltas.

**Decision matrix:**

| Scenario | Parallel? | Reason |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| EASY-tier 8+ issues, distinct branches | **NO — serialize** | Branch-namespace contention; cherry-pick consolidation is safer |
| MEDIUM/HARD issues, one at a time | YES (sequential) | Wait for completion before launching next |
| Mass rebase (agents own branches end-to-end) | YES | No shared HEAD contention |
| Single multi-part issue, hot-file ownership | YES (2 agents max) | Phase 0b pattern holds |
| Mnemosyne `/learn` parallel skill amendments | **NO — serialize** | Recurring contamination on shared clone |

**Recovery (cherry-pick consolidation):**

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b <epic>-consolidated

for branch in worker-1 worker-2 worker-3; do
  git fetch origin "$branch"
  git cherry-pick "origin/$branch"
  # resolve conflicts, run pre-commit, continue
done

gh pr create --title "feat(epic): EASY-tier batch consolidation" \
  --body "Closes #A
Closes #B
..."

for pr in <worker-prs>; do
  gh pr close "$pr" --comment "Consolidated into #<consolidated-pr>"
done
```

**Per-agent brief mitigation:**

```text
CRITICAL — branch check before EVERY commit:
  CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git -C <my-worktree-path> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "<my-assigned-branch>" ] && { echo "ABORT"; exit 1; }
  git -C <my-worktree-path> commit ...
Always pass git -C <absolute-worktree-path> — never trust plain `cd`.
```

### Phase 0b: Splitting a Single Issue (Hot-File Ownership)

Use when a single multi-part issue has 2 truly independent remediation items.

1. Survey remaining scope: `gh issue view <N> --comments` + recent merged PRs
2. Build a hot-file ownership matrix — every shared file must have ONE owner or be APPEND-ONLY
3. Detect merge policy once: `gh repo view --json squashMergeAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed`
4. `grep -E '^\[(feature\.|environments)' pixi.toml` — detect pixi env (don't assume `dev`)
5. Create per-sub-task worktrees: `git worktree add ~/<repo>/<issue>-a -b <issue>-a main`
6. Dispatch 2 opus agents in background mode; each brief MUST include: absolute worktree path,
   hot-file matrix, `--squash` vs `--rebase`, pixi env, `pre-commit run --files <changed>` before push,
   and "Do NOT edit 'still TODO'/'out of scope' lists in shared docs"
7. On completion: second PR may need rebase — `git rebase origin/main && pre-commit run --files <changed> && git push --force-with-lease`

| Sub-tasks | Throughput gain | Verdict |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- |
| 2 | ~1.7x | **Sweet spot** |
| 3 | ~2.0x | Marginal — coordination cost high |
| 4+ | <2.5x | Conflict risk dominates |

### Phase 1: Wave-Based Parallel Execution

Organize issues into dependency waves; waves with no cross-wave deps run simultaneously.
Send ALL `Task` tool calls for a wave in **a single message** for true parallelism.

**Agent instruction template:**

```text
Execute [Wave N / Issue #XXX]: [brief description]

CRITICAL: Use a dedicated git worktree. NEVER work in the main workdir.
1. git worktree add /tmp/<project>-<phase> -b <branch-name> origin/main
2. cd into it FIRST before any other git operation.
3. [Specific steps — exact file paths, function names, expected line counts]
4. pre-commit run --all-files
5. git commit -m "type(scope): description\n\nCloses #XXX"
6. git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <branch> && { echo "FATAL: exists"; exit 1; }
7. git push -u origin <branch>
8. gh pr create && gh pr merge --auto --rebase
9. git worktree remove --force /tmp/<project>-<phase>
Do NOT use harness isolation:"worktree" if agents need sibling branch visibility
(it creates a separate clone, losing cross-reference visibility).
```

### Phase 2: Branch Collision Hardening

**Failure mode**: Four parallel Haiku agents used `isolation: "worktree"` correctly but
used the same branch-naming template. 26 commits from 4 distinct branches collapsed onto a
single remote ref under one PR. (ProjectAgamemnon 2026-05-16, PR #386.)

**Fix — issue-number-suffixed branch names:**

```
# Pattern: <theme>-<issue-number(s)>-<date>
medium/clang-tidy-177-2026-05-16
medium/cmake-cleanup-182-189-2026-05-16
```

**Mandatory remote collision check before push:**

```bash
git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <branch> \
  && { echo "FATAL: branch <branch> already exists — STOP"; exit 1; }
git push -u origin <branch>
```

### Phase 3: Partial Contamination Recovery

**Symptom**: PR diff shows files outside the agent's declared scope. Detected via:

```bash
git log origin/<branch> ^origin/main --oneline
# Returns N+1 commits when N expected
```

**Recovery (verified-ci, PR #398):**

```bash
git fetch origin main
OWN_SHAS=$(git log origin/main..HEAD --format=%H -- <files-agent-actually-touched>)
git reset --hard origin/main
echo "$OWN_SHAS" | tac | xargs -I {} git cherry-pick {}
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>
```

**Prevention**: Forbid `git pull` inside agent worktrees. Validate diff scope before push:

```bash
EXPECTED_FILES="<list>"
ACTUAL_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD)
diff <(echo "$EXPECTED_FILES") <(echo "$ACTUAL_FILES") \
  || { echo "FATAL: out-of-scope files — STOP"; exit 1; }
```

### Phase 4: No-Worktree-at-All Anti-Pattern

**Never dispatch N parallel agents to the same working directory, even when their files
are disjoint.** (ProjectAgamemnon F-phase, 2026-05-18 — PRs #407, #409, #410.)

Disjoint files do NOT protect shared `.git/HEAD` and `.git/index`. Agents run `git checkout`
concurrently, causing HEAD-flip + commit-leak + stash/checkout/cherry-pick recovery cycles
requiring `git reflog` archaeology. Total wasted time: ~15 min/agent.

**Workdir strategy decision matrix:**

| Scenario | Strategy | Reason |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| 2+ parallel Sonnet impl agents (>5 min, multi-commit) | **Explicit `git worktree add /tmp/<name>`** | Disjoint files do NOT protect shared `.git/HEAD` |
| Single Haiku fix, <5 min, single commit, no concurrency | Main workdir OK | Setup cost exceeds risk |
| Agents needing cross-reference to sibling pushed branches | Local `git worktree add` (NOT harness flag) | Harness creates separate clone — loses visibility |
| EASY-tier 8+ Haiku swarm | Serialize or consolidate-via-cherry-pick | See Phase 0a |

**Recovery when contamination has occurred mid-flight:**

```bash
git reflog | grep '<commit-msg-prefix-you-wrote>'
git reset --hard origin/main
git checkout -b <correct-branch> origin/main
for sha in <your-shas-oldest-first>; do git cherry-pick "$sha"; done
git worktree add /tmp/<project>-<phase> -b <correct-branch>-iso HEAD
cd /tmp/<project>-<phase>
```

### Phase 5: Create, Switch, Sync Basics

```bash
# New branch from origin (conventional layout)
git worktree add .worktrees/issue-<N> -b <N>-feature-name origin/main
# Switch — just cd; no stash needed
cd <repo>/.worktrees/issue-<N>
# Sync inside worktree
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>
# Fix stale origin/HEAD
git fetch origin && git remote set-head origin --auto
```

**Path awareness:** Always resolve the worktree root before editing:

```bash
WORKTREE_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
FILE="$WORKTREE_ROOT/tests/shared/training/test_file.mojo"
# WRONG: /home/user/Project/tests/file.mojo (lands on main!)
# RIGHT: /home/user/Project/.worktrees/issue-NNN/tests/file.mojo
```

**Detect already-done work:** `git log --oneline -3` and `gh pr list --head <branch>` before planning.

### Phase 6: Constraint-Aware Worktree Cleanup

#### All-Clean Shortcut

When `git status --short` is empty for every worktree (0 dirty files), execute removal
directly — no script needed. The generate-first constraint exists only to prevent accidental
loss of real work.

```bash
git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{print $2}' | tail -n +2 | while read wt; do
  dirty=$(git -C "$wt" status --short 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  echo "$wt | dirty=$dirty"
done
# ALL dirty=0 → direct execution is safe
```

#### Locked Worktrees from Dead Agent PIDs

```bash
# Identify locked worktrees
git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{wt=$2} /^locked/{print wt " LOCKED"}'
# Check cleanliness
git -C <locked-path> status --short   # empty = clean
# Locked + clean: unlock and remove directly (no --force)
git worktree unlock <path>
git worktree remove <path>
# Locked + dirty: classify files first (Phase 6 below), then unlock+remove
```

#### Staged-Only Addition Cleanup (Status A Lines)

`git checkout -- .` alone does NOT clean worktrees that have staged new files (status `A`):

```bash
git -C <worktree> status --short | grep '^A'   # non-empty = staged additions present
# Three-step sequence required:
git -C <worktree> reset HEAD -- .    # Step 1: unstage
git -C <worktree> checkout -- .      # Step 2: restore tracked modified files
git -C <worktree> clean -fd          # Step 3: remove untracked
git worktree remove <worktree>       # now succeeds without --force
```

#### Cherry=1 Rebase-Merge Artifact Classification

`git cherry` reports `+1` for MERGED rebase PRs (hash rewrite). Always verify PR state:

```bash
pr_state=$(gh pr list --head "$br" --state all --json state --jq '.[0].state')
# MERGED → cherry=1 is artifact — safe to remove
# CLOSED → cherry=+1 is necessary-but-NOT-sufficient for "keep" — INVESTIGATE first (see below)
# NONE → real unreleased work — keep branch
```

**CLOSED + cherry=+1 is NOT automatically keepable work.** A PR can be CLOSED because its work
*landed on main through a DIFFERENT PR/branch* (superseded), not because it was abandoned-but-valuable.
Before deciding keep-vs-delete on a CLOSED-PR branch, run two investigative checks:

```bash
# Check (a): did the feature/content reach main via a DIFFERENT commit/PR?
git log origin/main --oneline | grep -i '<feature-keyword>'        # e.g. strict-rubric, marker symbol
git grep '<marker-symbol-the-branch-introduces>' origin/main -- . # is the content already on main?

# Check (b): does the branch's diff target files that STILL EXIST on main?
git diff origin/main...<branch> --stat
# If every path the branch touches no longer exists on main (file renamed/split/deleted),
# the diff is stale and unrebaseable — a strong "superseded" signal.
```

| Investigation result | Verdict |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| Content already on main via another commit/PR | **SUPERSEDED → delete** (`git branch -D`) |
| Branch only edits since-deleted/renamed files (vanished on main) | **SUPERSEDED → delete** (`git branch -D`) |
| Content genuinely NOT on main AND files still exist | **KEEP** (real unreleased work) |

Deletion uses `git branch -D` (capital), NOT `-d`: a cherry=`+` tip is not an ancestor of main,
so `-d` refuses. `git tidy` also cannot auto-remove these — local-only branches that were never
pushed (no tracking remote) or whose remote is already `[gone]` are the deliberate `git branch -D`
human step, taken only AFTER content-on-main is confirmed by the checks above.

#### Generate Reviewable Cleanup Script

When the user says "give me a script" or any worktree has potentially real dirty files,
generate a 7-section script (`/tmp/<repo>-worktree-cleanup.sh`):

- `set -euo pipefail`; `cd /path/to/repo`
- **§1 PRE-FLIGHT** — `git worktree list | wc -l`; `git branch | wc -l`
- **§2 COMMIT real work** — `git add <specific-files>` (NEVER `-A`); one block per dirty worktree
- **§3 CLEAN artifacts** — staged additions → 3-step (`reset HEAD -- . && checkout -- . && clean -fd`); otherwise 2-pass (`checkout -- . && clean -fd`)
- **§4 REMOVE stray agent files** — `rm -f .claude-prompt-*.md`, `rm -rf Mnemosyne`, `rm -f .issue_implementer`
- **§5 REMOVE worktrees** — explicit list, no wildcards, no `--force`
- **§6 PRUNE** — `git worktree prune && git remote prune origin`
- **§7 VERIFY** — `git worktree list` (expect 1); `git branch | wc -l` (unchanged)

#### Cross-Repo & Stale-Drift Safety Checks (verified-local, ProjectHephaestus 2026-06-15)

Three traps surfaced during a real `/worktree-cleanup` session. Run these BEFORE any destructive op.

**(a) Cross-repo check — a worktree-looking dir may belong to ANOTHER repo.** A directory under
the host repo's `build/.worktrees/` (e.g. `build/.worktrees/mnemo-skill-911`) was actually a
worktree of a DIFFERENT repository, spawned from a stray clone-within-a-repo at
`build/Mnemosyne`. It did NOT appear in the host repo's `git worktree list` (different
`.git`), yet showed up in a `git status` loop. A blind cleanup would have force-deleted genuine
uncommitted work from another project.

```bash
# Before touching ANY worktree-looking directory, confirm it belongs to THIS repo:
THIS_REMOTE=$(git remote get-url origin)
DIR_REMOTE=$(git -C <dir> remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)
[ "$DIR_REMOTE" != "$THIS_REMOTE" ] && { echo "OUT OF SCOPE: $dir belongs to $DIR_REMOTE — never remove"; }
# Red flag: a dir present in a `git status` loop but ABSENT from `git worktree list`
# belongs to a different clone — leave it alone.
```

**(b) Redundancy proof — a big dirty diff in a MERGED worktree is usually stale-checkout drift.**
Worktrees whose PRs are already MERGED showed huge dirty diffs full of `D` (deleted) and `M`
lines (e.g. `D hephaestus/automation/_implement_phase.py`). These were NOT new work — the working
tree had been edited toward a state main has long since passed. Prove redundancy before discarding:

```bash
gh pr list --head <branch> --state all     # MERGED = positive signal it's safe
# For each "deleted" file in the dirty diff, check whether it STILL EXISTS on main:
git cat-file -e main:<path> && echo "file exists on main → the local deletion is drift, not real"
# Confirm untracked files are only automation artifacts:
ls .claude-address-review-*.md .claude-followup-*.json followup-*.json 2>/dev/null
```

If `git cat-file -e main:<file>` succeeds for the "deleted" files, the deletion is local drift
(redundant with main), not a change worth preserving.

**(c) Safety-net-blocked bulk discard → hand the commands to the user.** Looping
`git reset --hard HEAD` + `git clean -fd` across many worktrees the agent UNILATERALLY judged
redundant was BLOCKED by the Claude Code auto-mode safety classifier as "Irreversible Local
Destruction not cleared by the general cleanup request." `git worktree remove` also refuses a
dirty worktree without `--force`, and `--force` is itself blocked. Resolution that worked: stop
auto-executing and surface the per-worktree command block for the user to run via the `!` prefix.

```text
# Clean worktrees (dirty=0), including locked-by-dead-PID ones, CAN be removed automatically:
git worktree unlock <path> && git worktree remove <path>      # no --force needed

# Force-discard of dirty-but-redundant trees needs the USER's hands — print, do not run:
#   (for each judged-redundant worktree)
#   git -C <wt> reset --hard HEAD
#   git -C <wt> clean -fd
#   git worktree remove --force <wt>
```

Only the force-discard of dirty-but-redundant trees needs user hands; everything clean is automatic.

#### Submodule Worktrees Refuse `git worktree remove` — Even When Clean (verified-local, HomericIntelligence Odysseus 2026-07-13)

In a repo with initialized git **submodules** (e.g. the HomericIntelligence Odysseus meta-repo,
~14 submodules incl. `research/ProjectOdyssey`), `git worktree remove <path>` REFUSES with:

```text
fatal: working trees containing submodules cannot be moved or removed
```

This fires even when the worktree is otherwise CLEAN, and even for a worktree whose only "dirty"
line is a submodule-POINTER change (`M research/ProjectOdyssey`) that is an artifact, not real
work (0 unique commits ahead of `origin/main`). Two workarounds that DID NOT clear it in-session:

- `git submodule deinit -f research/ProjectOdyssey` inside the worktree first — this cleared the
  submodule checkout, but `git worktree remove` STILL refused.
- `git worktree remove --force <path>` — blocked by the CC Safety Net (destructive).

**Resolution that worked:** hand the user the exact force-remove command to run themselves. Once
the user ran it, the worktree entries deregistered and the directories were gone.

```bash
# HAND TO USER (do not auto-run — --force is Safety-Net-blocked):
git worktree remove --force <worktree-path> && git worktree prune
# For a submodule-containing worktree that ALSO has a branch to delete after PR MERGED:
git worktree remove --force <worktree-path> && git worktree prune && git branch -D <branch>
```

**Three-method worktree classification that drove the keep/prune decision** (run all three per
worktree; a worktree is `CLEAN_PRUNE_OK` only when PR is MERGED AND status is clean):

```bash
for wt in $(git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{print $2}' | tail -n +2); do
  br=$(git -C "$wt" branch --show-current)
  # (1) PR state — MERGED / OPEN / none
  pr=$(gh pr list --head "$br" --state all --json number,state --jq '.[0] | "\(.state) #\(.number)"' 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PR")
  # (2) commits ahead of main (squash-merge caveat below)
  ahead=$(git -C "$wt" rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null)
  # (3) dirty check
  dirty=$(git -C "$wt" status --porcelain | wc -l)
  echo "$wt | br=$br | pr=$pr | ahead=$ahead | dirty=$dirty"
done
```

| PR state | ahead | dirty | Classification |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | -------------- |
| MERGED | >0 (squash) | 0 | `CLEAN_PRUNE_OK` — safe to remove |
| OPEN | ≥0 | any | `KEEP` — in-flight PR |
| none (`worktree-agent-*`, no remote) | 0 | 0 | throwaway — remove |
| any | any | dirty with real diff | INSPECT before deciding (see preserve-first below) |

**Squash-merge caveat:** a squash-merged PR's branch shows `ahead > 0` AND is ABSENT from
`git branch --merged` (squash collapses history into one new commit, so the old tip is not an
ancestor of main). Do NOT trust `git branch --merged` to detect merged work — trust the PR
`MERGED` state from `gh pr list`. Deleting such a branch needs `git branch -D` (capital), not
`-d` (which refuses a non-ancestor tip); hand it to the user WITH the PR-MERGED proof.

**Preserve-first: inspect dirty diffs before discarding — an "uncommitted change" can be junk
superseding merged work.** One worktree (`odyssey-5551-wt`) was dirty with uncommitted changes
that, on inspection, were an abandoned PARTIAL REVERT of an already-MERGED feature (PR #5582).
Correct handling: inspect (`git -C <wt> diff HEAD --stat`, then read a changed file), recognize it
as junk that would undo merged work, and ASK the user (discard / stash / leave) rather than
auto-commit or auto-discard. When the user chose discard, hand them:

```bash
# HAND TO USER (rm -rf + branch -D are Safety-Net-blocked / destructive):
rm -rf <worktree-path> && git worktree prune && git branch -D <branch>
```

**Orphan on-disk worktree dirs:** a `.claude/worktrees/agent-XXXX/` directory can exist on disk
WITHOUT being a registered worktree (`git worktree list` won't show it). Those are orphans —
`rm -rf` them directly (they hold no git registration to deregister).

**Safety-Net blocks encountered this session (ALL hand-to-user — do not work around):**

| Operation | Blocked | Hand-to-user command |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| `git worktree remove --force <wt>` | Yes | print for user + `git worktree prune` |
| `git checkout -- .` / `git reset --hard` (discard uncommitted) | Yes (even with explicit user "discard") | `git -C <wt> checkout -- . && git -C <wt> clean -fd` OR `rm -rf <wt>` |
| `git branch -D <branch>` (force-delete squash-merged/unmerged) | Yes | print with PR-MERGED proof; user runs it |
| `rm -rf <worktree-dir>` | Yes | print for user |

Pattern: for ANY destroy-uncommitted-or-unmerged op, PRINT the exact command for the user; do
not try to work around the Safety Net.

#### Gitignore Hygiene (Phase 0.5)

Run before cleanup operations to prevent re-accumulation:

```bash
git check-ignore -v .worktrees .claude/worktrees .coverage .claude/scheduled_tasks.lock
# Add missing entries to .gitignore:
# .coverage / .coverage.*
# .worktrees/ / .claude/worktrees/
# .claude/scheduled_tasks.lock
```

#### Inline Worktree Cleanup in a Rebase Loop

```bash
CLEANED_WORKTREES=()

maybe_remove_worktree() {
    local branch="$1" wt_path="$2"
    [ -z "$wt_path" ] || [ "$wt_path" = "$MAIN_REPO_ROOT" ] || [ ! -d "$wt_path" ] && return 0
    [ -n "$(git -C "$wt_path" status --porcelain 2>/dev/null)" ] && return 0
    local open_prs
    if ! open_prs=$(gh pr list --head "$branch" --state open --json number 2>/dev/null); then
        return 0   # gh failure → preserve worktree (failure-safe)
    fi
    [ -n "$open_prs" ] && [ "$open_prs" != "[]" ] && return 0
    git worktree remove "$wt_path" 2>/dev/null && CLEANED_WORKTREES+=("$branch")
}

for branch in "${BRANCHES[@]}"; do
    cd "$WORK_DIR"
    git rebase origin/main || { cd "$MAIN_REPO_ROOT"; continue; }
    git push --force-with-lease origin "$branch"
    cd "$MAIN_REPO_ROOT"   # CRITICAL: cd out BEFORE calling helper
    maybe_remove_worktree "$branch" "$WORK_DIR"
    # Guard: directory may now be gone — use -C, not CWD
    [ -d "$WORK_DIR" ] && git -C "$WORK_DIR" status --porcelain 2>/dev/null
done
git worktree prune   # replaces the old end-of-script stale-sweep
```

### Phase 7: Myrmidon Wave Pattern (20+ Mixed Worktrees)

**Triage categories before dispatching any agents:**

| Category | Criteria | Wave | Executor |
| -------- | -------- | ---- | -------- |
| A — Stale/Merged | `[gone]` remote OR merged PR OR 0 commits ahead | Wave 1 | Haiku |
| B — Unreleased | 1+ commits ahead, no merged PR | Wave 2a | Sonnet |
| C — Stale-PR conflict | Closed PR + suspected conflicts | Wave 2b | Haiku |

```
Wave 1: N Haiku agents (parallel) — remove stale/merged worktrees
Wave 2: SIMULTANEOUSLY
         Wave 2a: Sonnet agents for B (one per branch — reads diff for PR description)
         Wave 2b: Haiku agents for C conflict-check
Wave 3: 1 Haiku agent — prune + final verification
```

**Conflict pre-check (Category B/C):**

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase --onto origin/main origin/main <branch> --no-commit 2>&1 | grep -E "CONFLICT|error"
git rebase --abort 2>/dev/null
# Conflicts on closed-PR branch = superseded — keep closed; do NOT rebase
```

### Phase 8: Cross-PROCESS Worktree-Creation Race (Subprocess Workers)

**Distinct from Phases 0a/4.** Those cover cross-THREAD `.git/HEAD`/index contention among
agents sharing one interpreter. This phase covers cross-PROCESS contention: when a tool's
parallel workers are separate `subprocess.run` CHILDREN (each its own Python interpreter) that
share an on-disk worktree path.

**Foundation**: ProjectHephaestus issue-major automation loop (real 2026-06-21 output.log,
issues 1553/1547; fix PR #1568 / issue #1567). The loop runs each issue's phases as separate
`subprocess.run` children. With 2+ issues in parallel, two `hephaestus-ci-driver` subprocesses
start near-simultaneously and EACH runs `_sweep_orphaned_arming_records` (`ci_driver.py`), which
globs ALL `drive-green-armed-*.json` records in the SHARED `build/.issue_implementer` dir. Both
independently find the same merged orphan PR and both call `create_worktree(same_issue)` on the
same path `build/.worktrees/issue-1547` → `fatal: '.../build/.worktrees/issue-1547' already
exists` (git exit 128). It self-recovered via a repo-root fallback, but that cascaded into
spurious `/compact` "No conversation found with session ID" warnings (the fallback /learn ran in
a fresh session whose deterministic session_uuid never existed).

**Root cause**: `WorktreeManager.create_worktree` (`worktree_manager.py:185`) guards only with an
in-process `threading.Lock` + an in-memory `self.worktrees` dict. Those coordinate THREADS of one
interpreter only. Two separate processes each have their own `WorktreeManager`/lock/dict but share
the same filesystem path — so the in-process lock provides ZERO cross-process protection. The
`worktree_path.exists()` check is a TOCTOU race against another process's `git worktree add`.

**Decision — pick the lock by your parallel UNIT:**

| Parallel unit | Shared resource | Correct lock |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| THREADS of one interpreter | `.git/HEAD`, in-memory dict | `threading.Lock` (and serialize — Phases 0a/4) |
| Separate `subprocess.run` children / processes | on-disk worktree dir, state file | cross-process advisory `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` on a sentinel file |

**Fix — reusable cross-process `file_lock` primitive** (`hephaestus/utils/file_lock.py`):

```python
from hephaestus.utils.file_lock import file_lock, LockUnavailableError

# Serialize the WHOLE create/sweep across processes (blocking — waits for the holder):
with file_lock(state_dir / "orphan-sweep.lock"):
    # re-glob + re-load records here; the second sweeper finds them already terminal → no-op
    _sweep_orphaned_arming_records(...)

# Non-blocking variant (skip if another process holds it):
try:
    with file_lock(path, blocking=False):
        ...
except LockUnavailableError:
    ...  # someone else owns it — back off
```

Primitive contract: `@contextmanager file_lock(path, *, blocking=True)` wraps
`fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` (`LOCK_NB` → raises `LockUnavailableError` when `blocking=False`); opens the
sentinel securely with `os.open(... O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_NOFOLLOW, 0o600)` (refuses symlinks); does NOT
unlink the sentinel while held (inode-reuse hazard); Windows no-op fallback when `import fcntl`
fails. It was extracted from TWO pre-existing INLINE flock copies
(`github/rate_limit.py:359-435` `_open_secure_state_file` + `gh_global_throttle_acquire`, and
`automation/advise_runner.py:150-195`) — there was no generic helper and no `filelock` dependency.

**Why wrapping the WHOLE sweep (not just the create) is the fix:** holding the lock across the
entire sweep serializes the subprocesses; the second sweeper, on acquiring, re-globs + re-loads
records and finds them already terminal (the first sweeper called
`_mark_drive_green_learn_result`), so it no-ops. This closes BOTH the double-`/learn` and the
`create_worktree` collision at the source. Do NOT just `path.exists()`-then-create under no
lock — that guard is the TOCTOU race.

**Cascading-symptom lesson:** the race was masked by the self-recovery fallback (repo-root fresh
session), which then produced a DIFFERENT downstream symptom (`/compact` "No conversation found").
Trace cascading warnings back to the original masked failure rather than fixing the visible symptom.

subprocesses).

### Branch Deletion Policy

**CRITICAL: Never delete branches autonomously. Always defer to the user.**

```bash
# Identify candidates — present to user, do NOT delete
git branch -v | grep '\[gone\]'
git cherry origin/main <branch>  # '-' = in main; '+' = not in main
# For remote branch deletion (user-confirmed only):
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh api --method DELETE "repos/$REPO/git/refs/heads/<branch-name>"
# NOT git push origin --delete (triggers pre-push hooks)
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Sequential agent execution | Launch one agent, wait, then launch next | 10 issues × 3 min = 30 min; no parallelism | Launch all independent agents in ONE message |
| Agents working on main branch | Multiple agents working on shared branches | Merge conflicts when agents push simultaneously | Each agent gets its own worktree |
| Parallel agents without worktree isolation | Both agents shared the same working tree | Stale `.git/rebase-merge/` state from each other's abandoned rebases | Always assign each parallel agent a dedicated `git worktree` |
| Overly generic agent instructions | "Fix issues #479, #478 in parallel" | Agents waste time exploring; inconsistent approach | Provide step-by-step with exact file paths and function names |
| Shared temp branch prefix across agents | Agent 1 and 2 used same `tmp-r2-*` prefix | Conflicting temp branch names | Include unique batch ID in prefix: `tmp-b1-<N>`, `tmp-b2-<N>` |
| Parallel Haiku bundle agents, no branch-name uniqueness | Four agents used same naming template | 26 commits from 4 branches collapsed onto one remote ref (PR #386) | Issue-number-suffixed names + `git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <branch>` before push |
| Parallel Task isolation=worktree on 8 EASY-tier branches | 8 haiku/sonnet dispatched simultaneously | Multiple agents committed to parent repo's checked-out branch; sibling agents reported stat-cache deltas | `Task isolation=worktree` is path-isolated but NOT branch/index-isolated; serialize EASY-tier batches |
| Parallel Haiku bundle agents, partial contamination (PR #398+#401) | Two `isolation: "worktree"` agents near-simultaneous push | PR #398 acquired one stray commit from PR #401; diff showed unrelated `nats_client.cpp` | Recovery: `git reset --hard origin/main && cherry-pick <own-shas> && push --force-with-lease`. Do NOT try `git revert` or `git rebase --onto` |
| 3 parallel Sonnet agents "work directly here, NO worktree" (F-phase) | Dispatch told all three to operate in main workdir; files were disjoint | All 3 agents reported HEAD-flipping contamination; commits leaked between branches; ~15 min/agent of stash/checkout/reflog recovery | Disjoint files do NOT protect shared `.git/HEAD`. Every parallel impl agent MUST have its own worktree |
| Harness `isolation: "worktree"` for agents needing cross-reference | Set `Task(isolation="worktree")` on agents needing sibling branch visibility | Harness creates a separate CLONE — agents lose visibility into sibling pushed branches; also slower setup | For cross-reference needs, use explicit `git worktree add /tmp/<name>` inside the prompt |
| Parallel Mnemosyne `/learn` amendments | 5 parallel sub-agents amending skills on shared clone | Same contamination as EASY-tier swarm; agents wrote to wrong skill files/branches | Serialize `/learn` OR use a truly independent clone per agent |
| Edit files via absolute main-repo path from worktree | Used Read/Edit on main repo path while session rooted in worktree | Changes landed on main branch, not feature branch | Always run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before editing |
| Start implementation without checking git log | Planned work from prompt description alone | Work was already done in HEAD commit | Always run `git log --oneline -3` before any planning |
| Assume large dirty count = artifacts | 187 files dirty → assumed `__pycache__` noise | agent-a117bab3 had 32 real modified Python files on a merged branch | Always inspect `git status --short` output per-file; never assume based on count |
| Assume cherry=1 means unreleased work | Three branches showed cherry=1 despite MERGED PRs | Rebase-merge rewrites commit hashes; cherry count is 1 even though work is in main | Always check PR state; cherry count is only meaningful when combined with PR=NONE or CLOSED |
| Treat a CLOSED-PR branch with cherry=+1 as keepable unreleased work | Classified `fix/strict-simplify-pr-site4-581-v2` (PR #586 CLOSED, cherry=+1) as "real unreleased work — keep" by the old heuristic | PR #586 was CLOSED because the strict-rubric feature landed via #583/#585/#587, and the branch edited `prompts.py` which main had split into a `prompts/` package — the +1 diff (123 lines) was stale/superseded, not valuable | On CLOSED+cherry=+, verify (a) content on main via another commit/PR (`git log origin/main` keyword grep / `git grep <marker> origin/main`) and (b) the branch's files still exist on main (`git diff origin/main...<branch> --stat`) before deciding keep-vs-delete; if superseded, delete with `git branch -D` |
| `git checkout -- .` alone on staged-addition worktree | Ran `checkout -- .` then `git worktree remove` | `fatal: contains modified or untracked files` — staged new files (status `A`) survive `checkout --` unchanged | Run `reset HEAD -- .` first, then `checkout -- .`, then `clean -fd` |
| Execute destructive ops directly | Planned `git worktree remove` directly on dirty worktrees | User wanted a script to review first | All destructive ops go into a reviewable script; only read-only analysis runs directly |
| `git worktree remove --force` on dirty worktrees | Used `--force` for stubborn cases | Safety Net blocks `--force` | Clean stray files individually first, then remove without `--force` |
| Classify all locked worktrees as KEEP | Treated lock status as always ambiguous; printed manual unlock+force-remove commands for user | Unnecessary — locked+clean worktrees can be unlocked and removed directly without `--force` | Split on cleanliness: locked+clean → unlock+remove; locked+dirty → classify files first |
| `git worktree remove` on locked worktree directly | Ran remove without unlock | Fails with "is locked, use 'git worktree unlock' to unlock it first" | Always run `git worktree unlock <path>` before `git worktree remove <path>` |
| Skip .gitignore hygiene | Cleaned up worktrees but did not add worktree dirs to `.gitignore` | `.worktrees/` reappeared as untracked after next agent session | Run Phase 0.5 gitignore hygiene before cleanup |
| `git worktree remove "$WORK_DIR"` from inside loop that cd-ed there | Remove succeeded but every subsequent command failed — CWD was the deleted directory | `git worktree remove` returns 0; failures cascade silently | Always `cd "$MAIN_REPO_ROOT"` BEFORE calling remove; use `git -C <path>` for subsequent checks |
| `OPEN_PRS=$(gh pr list ...) && [ -z "$OPEN_PRS" ] && git worktree remove` | When `gh` failed (unauthenticated/offline), `$OPEN_PRS` was empty — script removed an in-flight worktree | Destructive default on `gh` failure is exactly backwards | Capture inside the `if`: `if ! open_prs=$(gh pr list ... 2>/dev/null); then return 0; fi` |
| Post-removal dirty-check via `cd "$WORK_DIR"; git diff-index` | After inline removal, `cd` failed silently; `git diff-index` ran on wrong directory | CWD-based git after possibly-removed directory yields wrong-tree results | Guard with `[ -d "$WORK_DIR" ]` first AND use `git -C "$WORK_DIR" status --porcelain` |
| End-of-script stale worktree sweep AFTER inline loop cleanup | Sweep re-queried `gh` and re-checked dirtiness on already-classified branches | Pure duplication; doubled `gh` API calls; second silent-failure surface | Replace sweep with `git worktree prune` + printed summary of `CLEANED_WORKTREES` |
| `gh pr merge --auto --rebase` (default) | Standard merge command | Repo had rebase merging disabled | Detect with `gh repo view --json squashMergeAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed` once, pass to all briefs |
| Single-PR fix agent edits in the shared main workdir because its target branch happened to be checked out there | Made review-comment + lint fixes directly in `/home/.../ProjectHephaestus` (not a worktree) while sibling swarm agents ran | A sibling agent ran `git stash` + `git checkout <other-branch>` on the shared repo mid-session; my unstaged edits vanished and `git -C <repo> status` showed a totally different branch (`623-auto-impl`) and different dirty files | NEVER edit in the shared main workdir during a swarm. Even a single-PR agent must `git worktree add /tmp/wt-<pr>-<branch> <branch>` first and work only there. The shared `.git/HEAD` and index belong to everyone |
| Assume lost unstaged edits are gone after the branch was switched out | Panicked the fixes were lost when the shared repo flipped to another branch | The sibling agent's `git stash` (run before its checkout) captured MY edits as `stash@{0}: WIP on 613-auto-impl` | Before redoing work, run `git stash list` and look for `WIP on <your-branch>`; `git stash apply stash@{N}` into your own fresh worktree to recover verbatim |
| Both agents append to same docs file end-of-file | Each appended a new H2 section at EOF | Agent A removed a "still out of scope" bullet that B's work made in-scope; rebase produced stale-bullet conflict | "Append-only" necessary but insufficient — also forbid editing "still TODO"/"out of scope" lists |
| Trusting local pre-commit pass after manual rebase conflict resolution | Resolved markdownlint conflict, force-pushed without rerunning hooks | Manual edit during conflict resolution introduced missing blank line; CI markdownlint failed | Always run `pre-commit run --files <changed>` AFTER manually resolving rebase conflicts |
| `pixi run -e dev` in split-issue agent brief | Used `dev` env name from instinct | Repo had envs `default`/`lint`/`docs`, no `dev` — agent commands failed | Brief should say "use `pixi run` (default env)" OR grep `pixi.toml` for env names first |
| Repeated `git -C <worktree>` for add/commit/push | Drove day-to-day git operations from parent harness | Permission-gated harnesses triggered repeated approvals; Git wrote locks through shared metadata | Once the worktree exists, use that directory as CWD and run plain `git` commands there |
| Sub-agent dispatched with `Agent(isolation="worktree")` used bare repo paths in Read/Edit | Read/Edit operated on user's main checkout instead of worktree | The harness does not enforce paths stay inside the worktree | Prompt MUST state: "Use the worktree path EXPLICITLY in every Read/Edit/Bash call. NEVER use bare `<repo>/...` paths." |
| Direct worktree creation without fetching | `git worktree add -b name path origin/main` on stale clone | `origin/main` did not exist locally (only `origin/master`) | Always fetch origin before referencing remote refs in worktree commands |
| Over-broad Wave 1 myrmidon removal | Removed all `worktree-agent-*` in Wave 1 without checking unreleased work | Discarded branches that could have been rebased and PRed | Categorize first (A/B/C triage), then remove only Category A in Wave 1 |
| Rebase of stale-PR branches without conflict pre-check | Attempted `git rebase origin/main` on closed-PR branches | All had conflicts — work was superseded | Run conflict pre-check before any rebase; conflicts on closed-PR = superseded, keep closed |
| Haiku for Category B rebase+PR | Used Haiku for rebase+PR wave | Haiku wrote generic/inaccurate PR descriptions without analyzing the diff | Sonnet required for Category B: needs to read diff and write meaningful PR title/body |
| Sequential Wave 2 myrmidon | Ran rebase+PR and conflict-check sequentially | Doubled time when both subtasks are fully independent | Run Wave 2a (Sonnet) and Wave 2b (Haiku) in parallel |
| Treat a dir under `build/.worktrees/` as one of THIS repo's worktrees | About to clean `build/.worktrees/mnemo-skill-911`, which sat under the host repo's build dir | It was a worktree of a DIFFERENT repo (Mnemosyne), spawned from a stray clone-within-a-repo at `build/Mnemosyne`; it never appeared in the host repo's `git worktree list` (different `.git`); a blind cleanup would have force-deleted genuine uncommitted work from another project | Before touching any worktree-looking dir, run `git -C <dir> remote get-url origin` and confirm it matches THIS repo's remote; a dir in a `git status` loop but ABSENT from `git worktree list` belongs to another clone — OUT OF SCOPE, never remove |
| Assume a big `D`/`M` dirty diff in a merged worktree is real work to preserve | Worktrees on already-MERGED PRs showed huge diffs full of `D hephaestus/automation/_implement_phase.py`-style deletions | The deletions were stale-checkout drift — the tree was edited toward a state main long since passed; the "deleted" files still exist on main, so the diff is redundant, not new work | Prove redundancy with `git cat-file -e main:<file>` for each "deleted" path (success = drift) + `gh pr list --head <branch> --state all` (MERGED = safe) + confirm untracked files are only `.claude-address-review-*.md`/`.claude-followup-*.json`/`followup-*.json` artifacts BEFORE discarding |
| Auto-loop `git reset --hard HEAD` + `git clean -fd` across 14 unilaterally-judged-redundant worktrees | Tried to bulk-discard dirty-but-redundant trees in auto mode | Claude Code safety classifier BLOCKED it as "Irreversible Local Destruction not cleared by the general cleanup request"; `git worktree remove` also refuses dirty trees without `--force`, and `--force` is blocked too | Auto-remove only CLEAN worktrees (incl. locked-by-dead-PID: `git worktree unlock <p> && git worktree remove <p>`, no `--force`); for force-discard of dirty-but-redundant trees, STOP and print the exact per-worktree reset/clean/remove block for the USER to run via the `!` prefix |
| In-process `threading.Lock` to guard worktree creation across `subprocess.run` workers | `WorktreeManager.create_worktree` guarded only with a `threading.Lock` + in-memory `self.worktrees` dict; two `hephaestus-ci-driver` SUBPROCESSES ran `_sweep_orphaned_arming_records` near-simultaneously | A `threading.Lock` coordinates only THREADS of one interpreter; each subprocess has its OWN lock/dict but shares the filesystem path, so both called `create_worktree(issue-1547)` → `fatal: '.../build/.worktrees/issue-1547' already exists` (git exit 128) | Check whether your parallel unit is THREADS or PROCESSES before choosing a lock; for subprocess workers sharing an on-disk path use a cross-process advisory `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` on a sentinel file, NOT a `threading.Lock` |
| `worktree_path.exists()`-then-`git worktree add` guard | Checked path existence, then created the worktree if absent | Across processes this is a TOCTOU race — the second process passes the `.exists()` check before the first's `git worktree add` completes, then collides | Serialize the WHOLE create (and its enclosing sweep) under a cross-process `file_lock`; the second holder re-globs/re-loads and finds the records already terminal → no-ops |
| Add a third inline `fcntl.flock` copy for the new lock site | Was about to inline another flock block in `ci_driver.py` like the two existing ones | Two inline flock copies already existed (`github/rate_limit.py`, `automation/advise_runner.py`) with no generic helper — a third copy is a DRY violation | Extract ONE reusable `hephaestus/utils/file_lock.py` `@contextmanager file_lock(path, *, blocking=True)` (secure `O_NOFOLLOW` open, `LockUnavailableError` on `LOCK_NB`, Windows no-op) and route all sites through it |
| Fix the visible `/compact` "No conversation found with session ID" warning | Investigated the `/compact` session-id warning as the primary bug | It was a CASCADED downstream symptom: the worktree-creation race self-recovered via a repo-root fallback whose fresh /learn session had a deterministic session_uuid that never existed | Trace cascading warnings back to the ORIGINAL masked failure; fixing the cross-process race at the source eliminated both the collision and the `/compact` warning |
| `git worktree remove <wt>` on a CLEAN worktree in a submodule repo | Ran plain `git worktree remove` on an Odysseus worktree whose only diff was a `M research/ProjectOdyssey` submodule-pointer artifact (0 unique commits) | `fatal: working trees containing submodules cannot be moved or removed` — git refuses to remove ANY worktree containing an initialized submodule, clean or not | In a submodule repo, `git worktree remove` cannot remove submodule-containing worktrees at all; `--force` is required and it is Safety-Net-blocked — hand the exact `git worktree remove --force <wt> && git worktree prune` to the user |
| `git submodule deinit -f <submodule>` inside the worktree, then `git worktree remove` | Deinitialized `research/ProjectOdyssey` inside the worktree hoping `git worktree remove` would then succeed | The submodule checkout cleared, but `git worktree remove` STILL refused with the same "contains submodules" fatal | `git submodule deinit` does not unblock `git worktree remove` — do not chase this workaround; go straight to handing the user `git worktree remove --force` |
| Trust `git branch --merged` to detect merged worktree branches | Used `git branch --merged` to decide which worktree branches were safe to prune | Squash-merged PR branches are ABSENT from `--merged` (squash collapses history so the old tip is not an ancestor of main) and show `rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD > 0`, looking like unreleased work | Trust the PR `MERGED` state from `gh pr list --head <br> --state all`, not `git branch --merged`/commits-ahead; delete the branch with `git branch -D` (capital) handed to the user with the PR-MERGED proof |
| Auto-discard a dirty worktree's uncommitted changes as cleanup noise | About to `git checkout -- .`/`rm -rf` the dirty `odyssey-5551-wt` worktree as throwaway | The uncommitted diff was an abandoned PARTIAL REVERT of an already-MERGED feature (PR #5582) — auto-discarding is defensible but auto-committing would have re-broken merged work; either way the agent shouldn't unilaterally decide | Preserve-first: inspect the dirty diff (`git -C <wt> diff HEAD --stat` + read a file), and if it's junk superseding merged work, ASK the user (discard/stash/leave); on discard, HAND them `rm -rf <wt> && git worktree prune && git branch -D <branch>` (both are Safety-Net-blocked) |
| `git checkout -- .` / `git reset --hard` to discard uncommitted worktree changes after the user said "discard" | Tried to run the discard directly since the user had approved discarding | CC Safety Net blocks discard-uncommitted ops (`checkout -- .`, `reset --hard`, `rm -rf <wt>`, `branch -D`) even WITH an explicit user "discard" approval — the approval is not the permission system | For any destroy-uncommitted-or-unmerged op, PRINT the exact command for the user to run via the `!` prefix; do not try to work around the Safety Net even after verbal user approval |

### Artifact Patterns, Safety Net, and Utilities

**Artifact patterns (always discard):**
`__pycache__` `.pyc` `.pyo` `build/` `dist/` `.egg-info/` `.claude-prompt-*.md`
`Mnemosyne/` `.issue_implementer` `.pytest_cache` `.mypy_cache` `.ruff_cache`
`.coverage.*` `htmlcov/`

**Safety Net interaction:**

| Operation | Blocked? | Workaround |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `git worktree remove --force` (untracked files) | Yes | Delete untracked files first, then remove without `--force` |
| `git worktree remove --force` (dirty merged-PR) | Yes | Unlock first, then ask user to run `--force` manually |
| `git reset --hard` | Yes | Use `pull --rebase` instead |
| `git checkout --` / `git restore` on tracked artifacts | Yes | Use `git stash` to park before rebase, then `git stash drop` after |
| `git worktree remove` (submodule-containing worktree, even clean) | N/A — git itself refuses (`--force` needed) | `--force` is Safety-Net-blocked; hand `git worktree remove --force <wt> && git worktree prune` to the user |
| `git checkout -- .` / `git reset --hard` (discard uncommitted) | Yes (even with user "discard" approval) | Print for user; `git stash` if recoverable is acceptable |
| `git branch -D <branch>` (force-delete squash-merged/unmerged) | Yes | Print with PR-MERGED proof for the user to run |
| `rm -rf /tmp/mnemosyne-skill-*` inside sub-agent | Yes | Run from orchestrator before spawning sub-agents |
| `rm -rf <worktree-dir>` (discard abandoned worktree) | Yes | Print for user; combine with `git worktree prune && git branch -D` |

**Stale /tmp cleanup before parallel /learn agents:**

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/mnemosyne-skill-* 2>/dev/null || true
git -C "$HOME/.agent-brain/Mnemosyne" worktree prune
# Prefer timestamp-suffixed paths to eliminate future collisions:
WORKTREE_DIR="/tmp/mnemosyne-$(date +%s)-<name>"
```

**Programmatic path extraction from porcelain output:**

```bash
# WRONG — extracts the git ref, not the filesystem path
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git worktree list --porcelain | grep "branch.*/$BRANCH$" | awk '{print $2}')
# CORRECT — tracks preceding worktree line
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git worktree list --porcelain 2>/dev/null | \
  awk -v branch="$BRANCH" '/^worktree /{path=$2} /^branch / && $2 ~ "/" branch "$" {print path}')
```

**Rebase conflict resolution:**

| File | Resolution |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `CLAUDE.md`, config files | Take `--ours` always |
| CI workflow YAML | Take `--ours` unless branch adds the workflow |
| Deleted file (modify/delete conflict) | Honor deletion with `git rm <file>` |
| Test files | Keep both sides' additions |

Squash-merge caveat (merged branches show ahead>0, absent from `--merged`) and a preserve-first abandoned-revert case (`odyssey-5551-wt`, junk revert of merged PR #5582) surfaced.
