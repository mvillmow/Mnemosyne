# License-Compatibility CI Gate (stdlib importlib.metadata, distributed-scope, bare setup-python+pip)

A planning-stage design for a license-compatibility CI gate on a pixi-managed Python
repo. The gate enumerates only the **distributed** dependency set from the package's own
`Requires-Dist` metadata (excluding the `dev` extra), resolves each dependency's license
across three metadata fields, and checks it against a two-tier allowlist that mirrors
`NOTICE`. It uses the Python standard library (`importlib.metadata` + `packaging`) rather
than `pip-licenses`, scopes to what the project *ships* (not the whole CI environment),
and — the R3 correction — runs the install on a **bare `actions/setup-python` runner with
plain `pip install -e ".[all]"`**, mirroring the repo's own unit-test jobs, instead of
pip-installing into a pixi-locked env. It is engineered to **fail loud** rather than
silently pass when its inputs are missing.

## Overview

| Item | Details |
| ------ | --------- |
| Objective | Block PRs that add a license-incompatible *distributed* dependency, without false-failing on dev-only copyleft tools (yamllint, bats-core) that NOTICE permits, without silently passing when metadata/extras are absent, and without the pip-into-pixi instability that triggered the R2 NOGO |
| Scope | Dependency enumeration from `Requires-Dist`, three-field license resolution, two-tier (permissive + per-package copyleft) allowlist, **bare setup-python + pip** install context, isolated advisory-on-main/blocking-on-PR CI job + pre-commit hook |
| Approach | stdlib `importlib.metadata` + `packaging.requirements` over `pip-licenses`; distributed-scope over environment scan; fail-loud over silent-pass; **install with bare `setup-python` + `pip install -e ".[all]"` (NOT pip-into-pixi); call the gate as plain `python3 scripts/...` (no pixi task wrapper); `fetch-depth: 0` for hatch-vcs** |
| Outcome | A gate that passes the current clean tree, fails on genuinely incompatible shipped deps, and errors (never no-ops) when blind — wired through the install path the repo already proves works |
| Verification | unverified |

> **Warning:** This skill records a **plan** (ProjectHephaestus issue #1219, re-planned
> **three** times after reviewer NOGOs: v1 pip-licenses, v2 stdlib metadata, R2 adding pixi
> task-wiring + fail-loud + `[all]` coverage, and this **R3** replacing the pixi-nested
> install with a bare `setup-python` + `pip` install context and dropping the pixi task
> wrapper). It was **never executed** — no CI run, no tests, no gate invocation. Treat every
> claim as a hypothesis until CI confirms.

## When to Use

1. You are building a CI job that blocks PRs introducing license-incompatible dependencies
   in a pixi Python repo with a `NOTICE` file.
2. You must decide **how to install the package + runtime extras** so the gate can *import*
   them — and you are choosing between a bare `actions/setup-python` runner with plain `pip`
   versus `pip install` inside a pixi-locked env.
3. A license gate false-fails the clean tree because an env-wide scan surfaced GPL dev tools
   (yamllint, bats-core) that `NOTICE` explicitly permits as dev-only.
4. A metadata-reading gate silently passes (`exit 0`) because the package isn't installed by
   dist name, `Requires-Dist` is empty, or a runtime extra (e.g. `nats-py`) is not installed.
5. License metadata is inconsistent across packages (trove `Classifier ::` vs
   `License-Expression` vs freeform `License`) and an exact-string match false-fails a package.
6. You are deciding how to scope the gate to the **distributed** deps (`Requires-Dist`)
   excluding the `dev` extra.
7. A platform-gated dependency (e.g. `tzdata` under `platform_system == 'Windows'`) is
   silently dropped from a Linux-runner scan.
8. An editable `pip install` of a **hatch-vcs dynamic-version** package fails or versions as
   `0.0.0` because `actions/checkout` did a shallow clone (no `fetch-depth: 0`).

## Verified Workflow

**Verification did NOT occur.** This skill is plan-stage only — nothing below was executed,
no CI ran, no tests passed. This heading exists solely to satisfy the marketplace validator's
required-section check (how prior PRs #2355/#2361/#2370 passed validation). The actual,
honest content lives under **## Proposed Workflow** below and is explicitly marked as an
unvalidated hypothesis. Do not read the presence of this heading as evidence of validation.

## Proposed Workflow

### Quick Reference

```yaml
# .github/workflows/<license-gate>.yml — install on a BARE setup-python runner with PLAIN pip,
# mirroring the repo's OWN unit-test jobs (test.yml:92, _required.yml:548/561 all do
# `pip install -e ".[dev,schema]"` on a bare setup-python runner). Do NOT pip-install into a
# pixi env: the repo's pixi `dev-install` task deliberately uses `pip install -e . --no-deps`
# BECAUSE pip+pixi co-managing one site-packages "leaves the working tree perpetually dirty"
# / causes lockfile churn (pixi.toml:23-35, issue #456).
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@<sha>
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0                 # REQUIRED: hatch-vcs needs git history to compute version
  - uses: actions/setup-python@<sha>  # v5.6.0 — VERIFY the sha matches the repo's other pins
    with:
      python-version: "3.13"
  - run: pip install -e ".[all]"      # install package + ALL runtime extras' deps from PyPI
  - run: python3 scripts/check_license_compatibility.py   # plain python3 — NO pixi task wrapper
```

```python

```

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Pick the RIGHT install context: bare setup-python + pip, NOT pip-into-pixi (the R3 correction, #1 trap)

A pixi repo has **two valid install contexts**, and the gate must use the one that matches
its need:

- **(a) pixi-managed envs** — for *source-only* tooling (`ruff`, `mypy`, `yamllint` analyze
  files and need **no** package install).
- **(b) bare `actions/setup-python` + `pip`** — for jobs that must **import** the package and
  its runtime extras with their dependencies.

The license gate needs context (b): it imports nothing of the package's code but must have
the **distributed deps installed with their own deps** so `importlib.metadata` can read them.

**VERIFIED in ProjectHephaestus's own CI:** every unit-test job installs with
`pip install -e ".[dev,schema]"` on a **bare `setup-python` runner** (`test.yml:92`,
`_required.yml:548/561`). Meanwhile the pixi `dev-install` task deliberately uses
`pip install -e . --no-deps` **because** pip and pixi co-managing the same `site-packages`
"leaves the working tree perpetually dirty" / causes lockfile churn (`pixi.toml:23-35`,
issue #456). The R2 plan's `pip install -e ".[all]"` **into** the pixi `lint` env is exactly
the fragile pip-into-pixi interaction that doc warns against — and it was the R2 reviewer's
top NOGO concern.

**LESSON: before adding a `pip install .[extra]` step to a pixi repo's CI, grep how the
existing test jobs install — mirror that bare `setup-python` + `pip` pattern; do not invent a
pixi-nested install.**

#### 2. Drop the pixi task wrapper — call the script with plain `python3` (KISS, R3 corollary)

The gate script is **stdlib + `packaging` only** and runs under plain `python3` once the
package is installed. The R2 plan wrapped it in a **top-level pixi `[tasks]` entry that
delegated into the feature env** — that indirection is **unnecessary for CI** and was itself
the source of the prior `command not found` wiring trap. R3 drops it entirely:

- **CI** calls `python3 scripts/check_license_compatibility.py` directly, after the bare pip
  install.
- **The pre-commit hook** reuses the repo's **existing** `pixi run --environment default
  python3 scripts/...` launcher — proven by the sibling `check_python_version_consistency`
  hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml:182`) — so no new pixi task is introduced anywhere.

**LESSON: don't add a pixi task wrapper when the script needs no pixi. Fewer moving parts =
fewer wiring traps; the R2 NOGO was caused by exactly such a wrapper.**

#### 3. Editable hatch-vcs install needs `fetch-depth: 0` (R3, small but real)

This repo uses **hatch-vcs dynamic versioning** — the version is computed from git tags at
build time. An editable `pip install -e .` on an `actions/checkout` **shallow** clone (the
default) can't see the tag history, so the build fails or versions as `0.0.0`. The license
gate job's checkout MUST set `fetch-depth: 0`.

**LESSON: any CI job that editable-pip-installs a hatch-vcs dynamic-version package needs
`fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout`.**

#### 4. Make the gate FAIL LOUD — never silent-pass (carried)

A gate that enumerates deps from `importlib.metadata.metadata(DIST).get_all("Requires-Dist")`
returns an **empty list** if the package isn't installed under its dist name or metadata is
absent → the scan finds zero deps → `exit 0` → a teeth-less gate that **always passes**. Two
loud guards:

- `sys.exit(2)` when `Requires-Dist` is empty/missing.
- `sys.exit(2)` when a declared distributed dep has **no resolvable metadata** — do **not**
  `continue` past `PackageNotFoundError`, which silently drops coverage.

Lock both with unit tests asserting `SystemExit.code == 2`. **Any gate whose "all clear" path
is reachable when its inputs are missing is a false-confidence gate; make blindness an error.**

#### 5. Reconcile installed-set vs declared-set; install `[all]` for coverage (carried)

VERIFIED during planning: in the local `default` pixi env, `nats-py` (the `nats` extra) is
**not** installed while `pygithub` / `jsonschema` / `defusedxml` are. A scan that only
classifies *installed* packages silently skips uninstalled runtime extras — exactly the
copyleft-bearing ones the gate targets. Fix:

- The CI job must `pip install -e ".[all]"` **on the bare setup-python runner** (step 1)
  **before** scanning, so every runtime extra is classified.
- The loud-failure guard from step 4 then turns any **still-missing declared dep** into a hard
  error.

**A license/dep gate must reconcile the DECLARED distributed set (from `Requires-Dist`)
against the INSTALLED set and fail on the gap, not scan whatever happens to be present.**

#### 6. Evaluate markers across a platform matrix (carried)

`Requirement.marker.evaluate({"extra": e, "python_version": v})` omits platform vars, so a dep
gated `platform_system == 'Windows'` (e.g. `tzdata`) evaluates `False` on a Linux runner and is
**dropped** from the scanned set — a silent platform blind spot. Evaluate each marker across a
small `{python_version} × {sys_platform/platform_system}` matrix and treat **any-satisfiable**
as in-scope. **When using markers to select a dependency subset, evaluate permissively across
platforms/pythons or you silently exclude platform-gated deps.**

#### 7. Scope to distributed deps, never an env scan (carried from v1→v2)

The v1 design ran `pip-licenses --with-system`, which scans the whole installed environment and
surfaced GPL **dev** tools (`yamllint`, `bats-core`) that `NOTICE` permits dev-only — so the
gate **false-failed the clean tree** (reviewer CRITICAL). Enumerate only the **distributed** set
from `Requires-Dist`: base deps (`marker is None`) plus runtime extras, **excluding the `dev`
extra** (so GPL dev tools are structurally unreachable). `packaging` is normally already a base
dep, so this adds no new dependency.

#### 8. Resolve licenses across three fields (metadata is inconsistent) (carried)

Verified live during planning, license metadata is *not* uniform — `pygithub` exposes **only**
a trove tag (no SPDX expr, no freeform). A robust resolver checks three fields in priority
order: (1) `License-Expression` (already SPDX), (2) the OSI trove `Classifier ::` tail mapped
via `TROVE_TO_SPDX`, (3) freeform `License` mapped via `LICENSE_ALIASES`. The v1 bug was an
exact-string match against one assumed spelling.

#### 9. OR-expression semantics + two-tier allowlist (carried)

`MIT OR GPL-3.0` is **compatible** — split on ` OR ` and pass if **any** disjunct is permissive
(the v1 inverted-OR bug rejected it). Allowlist is two-tier:

- **PERMISSIVE** (any package): `{MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0, ISC, Python-2.0}`.
- **ALLOWED_EXTRA_COPYLEFT** (per-package, NOTICE-justified): `{pygithub: {LGPL-3.0, LGPL},
  defusedxml: {PSF-2.0, Python-2.0}}`.

PSF must **not** be blanket-permissive (a v1 bug) — scope LGPL/PSF exceptions per package so a
new copyleft dep is still caught.

#### 10. Test against REAL metadata; unmapped license fails loud (carried)

Call `resolve_license(importlib.metadata.metadata(pkg))` on actually-installed packages to pin
the true schema — synthetic-only tests with author-assumed spellings are a tautology. An unmapped
license resolves to its raw string and (if not permissive) **false-fails** with a hint to extend
the tables — a deliberate false-fail over false-pass for a gate.

#### 11. CI + pre-commit wiring (carried, updated for R3)

- **Isolated sibling CI job** — one scan's failure must not block other CI checks.
- **Advisory on main, blocking on PR** — branch on `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`: exit `1` on
  `pull_request`, exit `0` otherwise. (Coverage/blindness errors exit `2` **always**.)
- **Edit `.github/workflows/*.yml` via `sed`/append, not the Edit tool** — the pre-commit
  security hook blocks Edit-tool writes to workflow files.
- **CI invocation**: plain `python3 scripts/check_license_compatibility.py` after the bare
  `pip install -e ".[all]"` (no pixi task).
- **Pre-commit hook**: `entry: pixi run --environment default python3
  scripts/check_license_compatibility.py` (the existing launcher), scoped
  `files: ^(pyproject\.toml|pixi\.toml|pixi\.lock|NOTICE)$`, `pass_filenames: false`.

### Risks / most-uncertain assumptions (reviewer focus)

1. **Bare-runner `pip install -e ".[all]"` resolves ALL runtime extras' deps from PyPI at CI
   time** — network-dependent and slower than a cached pixi env; a PyPI hiccup fails the gate.
   It is **unverified** whether this job caches pip.
2. **`[all]` is ASSUMED to aggregate every runtime extra.** If a future extra is omitted from
   `[all]` in `pyproject`, its deps are silently never installed — the loud-failure guard
   catches it (good) but couples the gate to `pyproject` `[all]` hygiene. (VERIFIED today
   `[all]` lists defusedxml/jsonschema/nats-py/pygithub/tomli, but not future-proof.)
3. **setup-python 3.13 + editable hatch-vcs build is assumed to succeed on the runner.**
   `fetch-depth: 0` is necessary but maybe not sufficient (build-backend availability, tag
   presence).
4. **The pre-commit hook runs in the pixi `default` env** where some runtime extras (`nats-py`)
   are **not** installed → the hook fails-loud locally even on a correct change. Intended (CI
   is authoritative) but may annoy contributors / generate false-local-failures; whether that
   UX is acceptable is a judgment call.
5. **Line-number anchors will drift.** `test.yml:92`, `_required.yml:548/561`,
   `pixi.toml:23-35/36`, `security.yml:3-8/39`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml:182`,
   `NOTICE:18/51/74` are plan-time reads.
6. **The SHA pin for `actions/setup-python`** (`a26af69...`v5.6.0) was written from
   convention, **NOT** verified against the repo's existing pin for that action — if the repo
   pins a different SHA elsewhere, mismatch.

### Externals relied on without full verification

- That **bare pip-install of `.[all]` resolves cleanly on CI** (network / PyPI availability).
- That the **`actions/setup-python` SHA pin matches repo convention**.
- That the **hatch-vcs editable build succeeds** under `setup-python` with `fetch-depth: 0`.
- That `[all]` **stays complete** (aggregates all runtime extras).
- That `importlib.metadata` matches the package by `DIST_NAME` exactly.
- SPDX OR-expression spellings beyond the ones observed (`Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-Clause`).

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Attempt 1 | `pip install -e ".[all]"` **into** the pixi `lint` env (R2) | Fights pixi's locked env — the repo's own `dev-install` uses `pip install -e . --no-deps` for this reason (pixi.toml:23-35, issue #456); churn / "perpetually dirty" tree / instability (R2 reviewer's top NOGO) | Use a **bare `actions/setup-python` runner + plain `pip`**, mirroring the repo's unit-test jobs (test.yml:92, _required.yml:548/561); grep how existing test jobs install before adding any pip step |
| Attempt 2 | Added a **top-level pixi `[tasks]` wrapper** to run the gate in CI (R2) | Unnecessary indirection + the original `command not found` wiring trap; the script needs no pixi | Script is stdlib + packaging; call `python3 scripts/...` directly in CI. Only the **pre-commit** hook needs the existing `pixi run --environment default python3 ...` launcher |
| Attempt 3 | Editable pip-install with hatch-vcs dynamic version on a **shallow** `actions/checkout` | hatch-vcs can't compute the version from git history → build fails or versions as `0.0.0` | Set `fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout` for any editable install of a hatch-vcs package |
| Attempt 4 | Metadata-reading scan returned `[]` when the package/metadata was absent | The scan found zero deps → `exit 0` → a teeth-less gate that always passes | `sys.exit(2)` on empty `Requires-Dist` **and** on any uninstalled declared dep — make blindness an error |
| Attempt 5 | Scanned only the *installed* packages | Uninstalled runtime extras (e.g. `nats-py`) were silently skipped — the copyleft deps the gate targets | CI installs `.[all]` first (on the bare runner), and the loud-failure guard hard-fails on any still-missing declared dep |
| Attempt 6 | `marker.evaluate` with only `{extra, python_version}` | A platform-gated dep (`tzdata`, Windows) evaluates False on the Linux runner and is dropped | Evaluate markers across a `python × platform` matrix; any-satisfiable == in scope |
| Attempt 7 | `pip-licenses --with-system` environment-wide scan (v1) | Surfaces GPL **dev** tools (yamllint, bats-core) that NOTICE permits dev-only → gate false-fails the clean tree | Scope to **distributed** deps via `Requires-Dist`; exclude the `dev` extra; prefer stdlib `importlib.metadata` |
| Attempt 8 | Exact-string license match against one assumed SPDX spelling (v1) | pygithub exposes only a trove classifier (no SPDX, no freeform) → false-fails | Resolve across `License-Expression` → trove `Classifier` (via `TROVE_TO_SPDX`) → freeform `License` (via `LICENSE_ALIASES`) |
| Attempt 9 | Reject if any copyleft substring appears anywhere in the expression (v1) | `MIT OR GPL-3.0` (permissive side choosable) wrongly rejected — inverted OR | Split on ` OR ` and pass if **any** disjunct is permissive |
| Attempt 10 | Put PSF in the blanket-permissive set (v1) | Any future PSF-licensed dep would silently pass | Per-package `ALLOWED_EXTRA_COPYLEFT` map (pygithub→LGPL, defusedxml→PSF), not a blanket entry |

### Observed install gap (live, during planning)

```text
default pixi env: pygithub/jsonschema/defusedxml INSTALLED; nats-py (nats extra) NOT installed
=> scan must `pip install -e ".[all]"` on the bare runner, then loud-fail on any still-missing dep
```

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1219 plan R3 (third re-plan after NOGO; planning only, not executed) | unverified — plan stage; replaces R2 pixi-nested install with bare setup-python+pip per repo's test.yml pattern |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1219 plan R2 (second re-plan after NOGO; planning only) | unverified — plan stage; added pixi-wiring + loud-failure + [all]-coverage (pixi-nested install superseded by R3) |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1219 plan R1 (first re-plan after NOGO; planning only) | unverified — superseded v1 pip-licenses with stdlib importlib.metadata distributed-scope |
