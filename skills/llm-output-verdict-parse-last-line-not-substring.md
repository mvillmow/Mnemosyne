# LLM Output Verdict Parse: Last-Line Regex, Not Substring

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-30 |
| **Objective** | Prevent false-positive verdict reads when a Python/shell consumer parses a discrete classification marker (`**Verdict: APPROVED**` etc.) from LLM output. Also prevent the complementary infinite-re-review loop when the verdict is malformed and never parseable, the inverse regression where a persisted-comment gate's last-wins guarantee is silently dropped by collapsing it onto a first-match parser, and property-based tests that freeze unverified parser assumptions. |
| **Outcome** | SUCCESS — regex fix shipped in PR #552; bounded-retry cap + WARNING diagnostic logging shipped in PR #670 (Issues #615/#616); two-parser distinction (gate last-match vs in-loop first-match) preserved during the GO/NOGO vocabulary unification in PR #679 (issue #678). Planning-review guidance now covers Hypothesis fuzz-test plans for LLM parsers where current semantics and dependency surfaces must be verified before approval. |
| **Verification** | verified-local — v1.3.0 amendment validated with `python3 scripts/validate_plugins.py`; earlier implementation evidence remains PR #670 CI and v1.2.0 local parser-suite evidence. |
| **History** | [changelog](./llm-output-verdict-parse-last-line-not-substring.history) |

## When to Use

- You are adding a Python or shell consumer that reads a classification marker (verdict, severity, action, command) from LLM output.
- The prompt that generated the output explicitly says "readers take only the LAST matching line" (or equivalent).
- The LLM is permitted to discuss multiple options before settling — multiple matching markers may legitimately appear.
- A substring `in` check would fire on a quoted/discussed marker.
- You are auditing an existing parser (skip-gate, finalize-gate, ship-gate) for false-positive reads.
- **A plan-review loop re-reviews the same issue every pass without ever terminating** — symptom of a malformed verdict that regex cannot parse.
- **The pipeline log gives no clue what the reviewer wrote** — only says "verdict is None" or "not APPROVED" at DEBUG level.
- **You must decide whether a verdict parser should be first-match or last-match.** Persisted / accumulating comment gates (long-lived GitHub comments that may collect an earlier draft verdict before the final one) need last-match-wins; single-line fresh-output parsers whose prompt contract guarantees exactly one verdict line can use first-match.
- **You are auditing a "parser unification" refactor** (e.g. unifying verdict vocabulary to GO/NOGO) that may have silently collapsed a persisted-comment gate onto a first-match parser, dropping its last-wins safety guarantee.
- **You are reviewing a plan to add Hypothesis/property-based coverage for LLM-output string parsers.** Verify the parser contracts first; do not let generated tests freeze semantics that were merely inferred from current implementation.
- **The plan cites local file paths, line numbers, package names, or dependency surfaces without live verification.** Re-check current files and manifests before approving a test-hardening plan.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```python
import re

# Anchored to start/end of line; MULTILINE so ^/$ match line boundaries.
# Strict anchoring is intentional (#551/#552) — do NOT loosen to avoid substring false-positives.
_VERDICT_PATTERN = re.compile(
    r'^\*\*Verdict: (APPROVED|REVISE|BLOCK)\*\*\s*$',
    re.MULTILINE,
)

def is_approved(body: str) -> bool:
    """Return True iff the LAST verdict line in `body` is APPROVED."""
    matches = _VERDICT_PATTERN.findall(body)
    return bool(matches) and matches[-1] == "APPROVED"


# --- BOUNDED RETRY CAP (#615) ---
MAX_UNPARSEABLE_VERDICT_PASSES: int = 3

def count_unparseable_verdict_passes(comments: list[dict]) -> int:
    """Count plan-review comments that have no parseable verdict line."""
    return sum(
        1 for c in comments
        if c.get("body", "").startswith(PLAN_REVIEW_PREFIX)
        and _VERDICT_PATTERN.findall(c.get("body", "")) == []
    )

def exceeds_unparseable_verdict_cap(
    comments: list[dict],
    cap: int = MAX_UNPARSEABLE_VERDICT_PASSES,
) -> bool:
    """Return True when malformed-verdict re-review has hit the cap."""
    return count_unparseable_verdict_passes(comments) >= cap


# --- DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING (#615) ---
# In is_plan_review_approved(), when verdict is None emit WARNING not DEBUG:
if verdict is None:
    first_line = latest_review_body.split("\n", 1)[0].strip()
    url_part = latest_review_url or "<no url>"
    logger.warning(
        "Issue %s: plan-review comment has no parseable verdict line "
        "(VERDICT_LINE_RE did not match) — first line: %r | url: %s",
        issue_ref(issue_number),
        first_line[:200],
        url_part,
    )
```

Three guarantees the regex provides that `MARKER in body` does not:

1. **Line-anchored**: the marker must occupy its own line (modulo trailing whitespace) — quoted/inline mentions cannot trigger.
2. **Last-match wins**: early APPROVED then later BLOCK → BLOCK wins.
3. **Strict token equality**: `matches[-1] == "APPROVED"` rejects look-alikes like `APPROVED_WITH_CHANGES`.

### Two Parsers: Gate (last-match) vs In-Loop (first-match)

A single pipeline can legitimately need **two different verdict parsers**. Whether a parser
should take the **first** or the **last** match is dictated by the **INPUT contract** of the
text it reads, not by stylistic preference. Conflating them is a real regression (see Failed
Attempt 8).

| Parser | Input it reads | Input contract | Match semantics | Fail-safe direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Persisted-comment GATE** (`is_*_approved` on a stored `## 🔍 Plan Review` comment) | A long-lived GitHub comment that decides "may the implementer proceed?" | **May accumulate lines** — discussion + an earlier draft verdict before the reviewer's FINAL word | **LAST-match-wins** (`findall(...)[-1]`) | Fail toward **NOGO** (re-review is safe; GO would implement an unreviewed plan — the #455/#468/#484 bug class) |
| **In-loop / fresh-output** (`parse_review_verdict` on the reviewer's just-emitted reply) | The reviewer's reply produced inside the loop, per the prompt contract "end your response with EXACTLY ONE verdict line, emit NOTHING after it" | **Exactly one line** (prompt-guaranteed) | **First-match is fine** (`.search()`) | Fail to **NOGO** on AMBIGUOUS |

The persisted-comment gate must use a **dedicated** last-match regex — do NOT reuse the
in-loop first-match parser for it:

```python
import re

# Dedicated GATE regex: persisted comment may accumulate an earlier draft verdict
# before the reviewer's FINAL one. The reviewer's LAST word must win.
# `\**` tolerates optional markdown bold; line-anchored via re.MULTILINE.
_GATE_VERDICT_RE = re.compile(
    r"^\s*\**\s*Verdict\s*:\s*\**\s*(GO|NO[\s-]?GO)\b",
    re.MULTILINE | re.IGNORECASE,
)

def gate_allows_proceed(persisted_comment_body: str) -> bool:
    """Return True iff the LAST Verdict line in the persisted review is GO."""
    matches = _GATE_VERDICT_RE.findall(persisted_comment_body)
    if not matches:
        return False  # no parseable verdict → fail safe (re-review)
    last = matches[-1].upper().replace(" ", "").replace("-", "")
    return last == "GO"  # NOGO (or anything else) → do not proceed
```

The in-loop parser, reading fresh single-line output, may use first-match safely because the
prompt contract guarantees exactly one verdict line:

```python
def parse_review_verdict(fresh_reply: str) -> str:
    """First-match is correct: the prompt guarantees exactly one verdict line."""
    m = _GATE_VERDICT_RE.search(fresh_reply)  # .search() = first match
    if m is None:
        return "NOGO"  # AMBIGUOUS / missing → fail safe to NOGO
    return "GO" if m.group(1).upper().replace(" ", "").replace("-", "") == "GO" else "NOGO"
```

**Clarification — line-anchoring already handles inline prose for BOTH parsers.** The anchored
`^\s*\**\s*Verdict\s*:` pattern ignores mid-sentence mentions like
`we did not pick Verdict: GO here` because that line does not START with `Verdict:`. So
inline-prose false positives are handled by line-anchoring **regardless** of first-vs-last
choice. The first-vs-last decision is purely about which of *several legitimately-anchored*
verdict lines wins.

### Planning Property-Based Parser Tests

When reviewing a plan that adds Hypothesis or other property-based tests for LLM-output
parsers, separate **observed implementation behavior** from **intended contract** before
approving. Generated tests are high-leverage regression guards, but they can also lock in
accidental behavior if the plan treats unverified current code as the specification.

Use this reviewer checklist before implementation:

1. **Verify parser semantics against current code and issue intent.** For ProjectHephaestus
   issue #1470, the uncertain assumptions were: `parse_review_verdict()` intentionally uses
   first-match semantics, `latest_verdict()` intentionally uses last-match semantics,
   `_parse_coordinator_results()` intentionally extracts every fenced JSON block while
   skipping malformed fenced JSON, and `_parse_addressed_block()` intentionally inherits
   last-fenced-block/default behavior through `parse_json_block()`. Confirm these are still
   true and desired before approving tests that assert them.
2. **Re-check every cited source of truth live.** Plans may cite remembered or previously
   inspected file paths, line numbers, package names, PyPI names, or APIs. Treat those as
   pointers, not evidence. Re-open the current files and manifests before review sign-off.
3. **Bound generated inputs for CI.** `st.text()` and arbitrary Unicode can expose real bugs,
   but unbounded strategies can also create slow, flaky, or hard-to-reproduce CI failures.
   Keep `max_size`, example counts, and deadlines explicit, and blacklist surrogate code
   points when the parser is not meant to handle them.
4. **Update every active dependency surface.** Adding Hypothesis to one manifest is not
   enough when the repo supports multiple install paths. Check `pyproject.toml`, Pixi or
   lockfile-managed dev environments, and generated lockfiles together.
5. **Prefer stable contracts over private implementation shape.** It is acceptable to test
   private parser helpers when they are the only stable seam for LLM-output contracts, but
   assertions should describe externally meaningful behavior: never raises on malformed
   model text, line anchoring, first-vs-last match semantics, JSON block selection, and safe
   defaults.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Read the prompt template used to generate the LLM output.** Find the explicit "format" instruction. Example from `hephaestus/automation/prompts.py:474-475`: *"End your response with exactly one of the following verdict lines … readers take only the LAST matching line."*

2. **Match the prompt's stated semantics in the parser.**

   | Prompt instruction | Correct parser |
   |---|---|
   | "last matching line wins" | `re.findall(pattern, text, re.MULTILINE)[-1]` |
   | "exactly one verdict at the end" | `text.strip().splitlines()[-1]` plus format assertion |
   | "JSON block at end" | `re.findall(r'```json\n(.*?)\n```', text, re.DOTALL)[-1]` then `json.loads` |
   | "verdict on its own line, anywhere" + "if multiple, treat as error" | `findall` then assert `len(matches) == 1` |

3. **Add bounded-retry guard** when the consumer is in a loop that re-requests reviews:

   ```python
   # Before requesting another review cycle:
   if exceeds_unparseable_verdict_cap(comments):
       logger.error(
           "Issue %s: %d malformed-verdict passes — skipping re-review, needs human",
           issue_ref(issue_number), count_unparseable_verdict_passes(comments),
       )
       return  # surface for human attention instead of looping forever
   ```

4. **Log at WARNING (not DEBUG)** when verdict is None. Include the **first line of the offending comment body** and its **URL**. Without this, a malformed verdict is indistinguishable from "no review comment yet" in the logs, making the loop invisible for days.

5. **Add tests covering at minimum:**

   - Single matching line at end of body → correct verdict.
   - Multiple lines (early APPROVED, late BLOCK) → last wins (BLOCK).
   - Quoted/inline marker → NOT triggered.
   - Marker with trailing whitespace/CRLF → still matches.
   - Malformed body (no matching line) → None, does not raise.
   - `count_unparseable_verdict_passes` counts only review comments with no parseable verdict.
   - `exceeds_unparseable_verdict_cap` returns True at threshold, False below.
   - `exceeds_unparseable_verdict_cap` with custom cap works.

6. **Co-locate the prompt and the parser** in a single review. The defect shipped because the prompt lived in `prompts.py` and the parser in `plan_reviewer.py`, touched in separate PRs.

7. **For property-based parser coverage, first classify each assertion as documented contract,
   issue intent, or current implementation.** Only documented contract and confirmed issue
   intent should become hard properties. If current implementation behavior is desirable but
   undocumented, update the plan to verify or document it before freezing it in fuzz tests.

8. **For dependency additions, review every supported installation path.** In a Python repo
   with both `.[dev]` and Pixi workflows, the implementation should update the optional dev
   dependency group, Pixi dev dependency section, and lockfile via the resolver rather than
   hand-editing generated files.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `if "APPROVED" in text:` (substring `in` check, originating defect in `plan_reviewer.py:342`) | Matches the substring anywhere — quoted markers, "NOT APPROVED" prose, early APPROVED overridden by BLOCK all return True. Violates the prompt's "last matching line wins" contract. | Substring `in` against an LLM body cannot enforce line position or last-match semantics — never use it for discrete classification markers. |
| 2 | `if text.endswith("APPROVED"):` | Brittle. Claude may emit trailing whitespace, a postscript, markdown emphasis after the verdict. Returns False when verdict is APPROVED. | `endswith` assumes literal trailing position, which Claude's free-form formatting breaks routinely. |
| 3 | `text.split("\n")[-1] == "APPROVED"` | Assumes the verdict is the literal last line. Breaks when Claude adds a postscript. | "Last line of body" ≠ "last matching line of body". Filter for matching lines first, then take the last. |
| 4 | `re.search(r"APPROVED", text)` | Identical false-positive surface to substring `in` — no line anchoring, no last-match semantics. | A regex without anchors, without `re.MULTILINE`, using `search` not `findall(...)[-1]` provides zero additional safety over `in`. The flags matter as much as the pattern. |
| 5 | Log malformed verdict at DEBUG level | When verdict returned None, only DEBUG log emitted — no clue what the reviewer wrote; loop ran 12+ times per issue unseen | Malformed verdict is an actionable operator alert: log at WARNING with first line of offending comment body + URL. |
| 6 | No retry cap on malformed verdicts | Loop called re-review every pass when verdict was None | Same issues re-reviewed 12× across loops 2–5 (#455/#468/#484). Add `count_unparseable_verdict_passes()` + `exceeds_unparseable_verdict_cap()` with cap=3. |
| 7 | Loosen the strict regex to catch more variants | Considered removing `^...$` anchoring to tolerate whitespace/markdown decorators | Strict anchoring is intentional — it prevents the false-positive substring matches that caused #551/#552. NEVER loosen VERDICT_LINE_RE; fix the LLM prompt output instead. |
| 8 | Unify the persisted-comment gate onto the in-loop first-match parser during a vocabulary refactor (GO/NOGO unification, PR #679) | First-match silently broke last-wins → a `Verdict: GO … on reflection … Verdict: NOGO` review (reviewer changed its mind to REJECT) parsed as GO, would implement a rejected plan. Caught only by two failing regression tests (`test_false_when_go_precedes_nogo_in_same_body`, `test_true_when_nogo_precedes_go_in_same_body`) whose docstrings guard the last-wins contract. | Match semantics follow the INPUT contract — "exactly one line" (fresh output) vs "may accumulate lines" (persisted state); keep two parsers, do NOT collapse them. |
| 9 | Treat current parser code as the full specification while planning property tests | The plan can freeze accidental behavior if first-match, last-match, JSON-block extraction, or default-on-failure semantics were inferred rather than documented or issue-approved | Before generated tests assert a behavior, verify the code, prompt contract, and issue intent all agree; otherwise mark it as an open review question. |
| 10 | Use broad arbitrary string strategies without tight bounds | Hypothesis may generate very large or awkward Unicode inputs, making CI slow, flaky, or difficult to reproduce | Keep `max_size`, `max_examples`, and `deadline` explicit; avoid surrogate code points unless the parser is expected to handle them. |
| 11 | Add Hypothesis to only one dependency manifest | `pixi run pytest` and `.[dev]` installs can diverge, and CI may fail even if local editable installs work | Update every active dev/test dependency surface and regenerate lockfiles with the repository's resolver. |
| 12 | Assert private helper internals too tightly | Tests become brittle to harmless parser refactors and discourage cleanup | Test stable LLM-output contracts: safe defaults, no exceptions on malformed text, line anchoring, match selection semantics, and JSON block selection. |

## Results & Parameters

**Recommended regex (Python):**

```python
re.compile(r'^\*\*Verdict: (APPROVED|REVISE|BLOCK)\*\*\s*$', re.MULTILINE)
```

**Recommended consumer logic:**

```python
matches = _VERDICT_PATTERN.findall(body)
verdict = matches[-1] if matches else None
is_approved = verdict == "APPROVED"
```

**Bounded-retry constants:**

```python
MAX_UNPARSEABLE_VERDICT_PASSES: int = 3  # surface for human after 3 failed parses
```

**GO/NOGO gate regex (persisted-comment gate, last-match-wins):**

```python
_GATE_VERDICT_RE = re.compile(
    r"^\s*\**\s*Verdict\s*:\s*\**\s*(GO|NO[\s-]?GO)\b",
    re.MULTILINE | re.IGNORECASE,
)
# Gate (persisted comment, may accumulate lines): findall(...)[-1]  → last-match-wins
# In-loop (fresh single-line reply, prompt guarantees one line): .search() → first-match
```

**Planning-review checklist for property-based LLM-parser tests:**

```text
Before approving a Hypothesis parser-test plan:
- Re-open the current parser files; do not trust stale line numbers.
- Confirm first-match vs last-match semantics against prompt/issue intent.
- Confirm JSON-block selection semantics are intended, not incidental.
- Check every install path that must receive the new test dependency.
- Require bounded strategies so CI remains deterministic enough to debug.
```

**Cross-language equivalents:**

| Language | Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `re.compile(r'^\*\*Verdict: (APPROVED\|REVISE\|BLOCK)\*\*\s*$', re.MULTILINE)` | Use `findall(...)[-1]`. |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `/^\*\*Verdict: (APPROVED\|REVISE\|BLOCK)\*\*\s*$/gm` | Use `[...body.matchAll(re)].at(-1)?.[1]`. |
| Go | `regexp.MustCompile("(?m)^\*\*Verdict: (APPROVED\|REVISE\|BLOCK)\*\*\s*$")` | `FindAllStringSubmatch(body, -1)`; take last element. |
| Rust | `Regex::new(r"(?m)^\*\*Verdict: (APPROVED\|REVISE\|BLOCK)\*\*\s*$")?` | `captures_iter(body).last()`. |
| Bash | `grep -E '^\*\*Verdict: (APPROVED\|REVISE\|BLOCK)\*\*\s*$' \| tail -1` | Pipe through `tail -1` to enforce last-match-wins. |

**Required test cases (minimum):**

1. `body = "**Verdict: APPROVED**\n"` → APPROVED.
2. `body = "**Verdict: APPROVED**\n\nOn reflection…\n\n**Verdict: BLOCK**\n"` → BLOCK (last-match-wins).
3. `body = "we should NOT mark this **Verdict: APPROVED** because…\n**Verdict: REVISE**\n"` → REVISE (inline marker not line-anchored).
4. `body = "**Verdict: APPROVED**   \r\n"` → APPROVED (trailing whitespace / CRLF tolerated).
5. `body = "No verdict here."` → None / False.
6. `body = ""` → None / False.
7. 3 review comments with no parseable verdict → `count_unparseable_verdict_passes == 3`, `exceeds_cap True`.
8. **Gate, GO precedes NOGO** (`test_false_when_go_precedes_nogo_in_same_body`): `body = "Verdict: GO\non reflection…\nVerdict: NOGO\n"` → gate returns **False** (last-match-wins; reviewer's final NOGO must win).
9. **Gate, NOGO precedes GO** (`test_true_when_nogo_precedes_go_in_same_body`): `body = "Verdict: NOGO\non reflection…\nVerdict: GO\n"` → gate returns **True** (last GO wins).
10. **In-loop, single line** (fresh reply, prompt-guaranteed one line): `reply = "…\nVerdict: NOGO\n"` → `parse_review_verdict` returns `"NOGO"`; first-match is safe because exactly one line is present.
