# Multi-Repo PR Automation Loop and Swarm Orchestration

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-07-08 |
| **Objective** | One canonical for driving PRs to green across many HomericIntelligence repos via an automation loop or a myrmidon swarm: make the driver report honestly (no silent no-op, wait for the real terminal state, gate "repo done" on live open-PR count), cross-check every run summary against live GitHub state before reporting success, unblock the loop-runner / implementer deadlocks (drive-green discovery + the `state:implementation-go` labeling deadlock), orchestrate parallel waves across 3+ repos with sequential-within-repo merge ordering, run ecosystem-wide and org-wide planned-issue sweeps, and bulk-process automated review-plan files across stale PR branches. |
| **Outcome** | Driver hardened across five ProjectHephaestus releases (PRs #833/#837/#839 → #876 → #879 → #1090) from "lies success" → "honest reporting" → "waits for the real outcome" → "re-arms, survives concurrency, resolves conflicts, never self-inflicts a lint failure" → "BLOCKED early-exit (PR #1090 closes #1088)". Existing-PR labeling deadlock shipped fixed (PRs #1073/#1075/#1077/#1079). Report-vs-live-state protocol surfaced honesty gaps merged as PR #849. Swarm pattern merged 87 PRs across 8 repos and ran ecosystem sweeps (51+ PRs / 78 issues retired, 0 broken-main events). Org-wide planned-issue swarm piloted ~51 signed squash-auto-merge PRs across 5 repos (430 plan-carrying issues detected). Batch review-plan processing cleared 14 OPEN PRs in ~20-30 min. v1.3.0 extends report-vs-live-state to PLAN time: re-planning a 20-day-stale completed-sweep report (Odysseus #299) found ~13 "flagged for human" PRs mostly already merged and every surviving root cause stale — adding the stale-report re-verify pattern, a plan-time BLOCKED-zero-failures-vs-with-failures classification, and four cheap live-state verification commands. v1.4.0 sharpens that pattern after a reviewer NOGO on the R1 re-plan: a stale report's ROOT-CAUSE diagnosis can be not just outdated but actively WRONG — the Keystone #568 report blamed an empty-envvar container name and a `_required.yml` env fix that reading the branch DISPROVED (static `container_name`, envvars already set), while the live failing log showed the real cause was an unavailable pinned podman apt version (`action.yml:97` / `podman-version.env:1`); plus two reviewer-forced verification rules (lock scope reductions with a per-PR state loop; confirm review gates against the live ruleset). v1.5.0 adds ProjectHephaestus PR #1854 / issue #1818: direct pipeline `--issues` / `--prs` scopes must seed and classify via per-target-repo GitHub accessors, regression tests should poison ambient helpers, and an interrupted post-merge `RESUMABLE at merge_wait` needs explicit GitHub merge proof plus dry-run reclassification to `finished PASS`. |
| **Verification** | verified-ci (driver hardening and scoped direct pipeline behavior through ProjectHephaestus PR #1854); verified-local for v1.6.0 direct PR terminalization in ProjectHephaestus PR #2024 / issue #2023; v1.4.0 wrong-root-cause diagnosis techniques verified-local, while the specific Keystone #568 fix value remains unverified |
| **Latest Update** | v1.7.0 adds ProjectHephaestus PR #2658 / issue #2378: the implementation review can authorize the loop-owned `state:implementation-go` transition without a GitHub approval review; `merge_wait` still requires fresh exact-head proof and live check evidence before merging. |

## When to Use

- An automation loop (`drive-prs-green`, `hephaestus-automation-loop`, `loop_runner.py`, `ci_driver.py`) across multiple repos skips PRs, reports success wrongly, silently no-ops, or never arms auto-merge.
- The driver logs `pushed CI fixes for PR #N` but `gh pr view <N> --json headRefOid` shows the SAME SHA hours later.
- A run summary (`Driven: 8 / Failed: 4`, `_summary.json`) disagrees with the GitHub UI; you are about to tell a user "all repos are green".
- A `drive-green` phase prints `SKIP (no open issues)` / `SKIP (not final loop)` while failing PRs sit untouched, or a green PR never gets `state:implementation-go` so auto-merge never arms.
- A myrmidon swarm orchestrates PRs across 3+ repos with sequential-within-repo merge ordering (merge/conflict/CI-fix waves, Odysseus submodule pin bumps).
- An ecosystem-wide sweep classifies 500+ issues and implements them in parallel waves or bundle-PR-per-repo.
- An org-wide planned-issue backlog (issues carrying a `# Implementation Plan` comment) across 10+ repos needs one signed squash-auto-merge PR per issue.
- Automated review-plan files (`review-plan-*.md` + `review-*.json` with `phase=failed`) need bulk processing across 10+ stale PR branches.
- A `--issues`-scoped drive-green run still pulls in unrelated bot PRs or scans/arms every open PR and fails `rc=1` on out-of-scope PRs.
- A direct pipeline run with explicit scopes (`--issues` or `--prs`) queues work for the wrong repository, seeds coordinator state from the ambient current repo, or reads PR implementation labels through ambient GitHub helpers instead of per-target-repo accessors.
- A direct PR seed is already `MERGED` or `CLOSED`, but the queue-based pipeline continues into branch lookup, worktree adoption, or implementation-label routing and reports a failure after the PR is already terminal.
- A direct `--prs` pipeline run exits red even though the latest attempt passed because an older failed attempt for the same logical PR is still counted in summaries, preserved-worktree guidance, or exit-code calculation.
- A direct implementation PR reaches `state:implementation-go` and merge without a GitHub approval review or inline thread — verify the target repository's required-review count, the loop-owned label event, the exact reviewed head, and live checks instead of treating missing native review metadata as a failed loop review.
- You are PLANNING (not driving) against a STALE completed-sweep / status-report issue — e.g. a myrmidon "open-PR health + auto-fix sweep" report, marked COMPLETED weeks ago, that lists ~13 "flagged for human" PRs. Do NOT trust the report's action items or root causes; re-verify the LIVE state of every flagged PR first.
- The plan you are about to write classifies an open PR as `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED` and you are tempted to prescribe a "CI fix" — first confirm whether BLOCKED is caused by failing/pending required checks (real CI work) or by a branch-protection / review gate with all required checks green (approve+merge, NOT a CI fix).
- A report's stated root cause is a specific defect (a stale lockfile format version, a not-yet-removed file, a workflow `--tmpfs …:noexec` mount) — verify it still exists at the live HEAD/branch before planning a fix for it; the fix may have already landed.
- A report names a ROOT CAUSE for a PR that is STILL failing and prescribes a fix targeting a specific file/line — do NOT trust the causal claim even though the PR is genuinely red. The report can be both right that the PR fails AND wrong about WHY. Before writing the fix, READ the named file at the PR's ref (`gh api .../contents/<f>?ref=<branch>` or check it out) AND pull the latest failing run (`gh run view <id> --log-failed`). The prescribed fix may already be in place and the true failing step something else.
- You are about to assert "these N PRs already merged, so the sweep scope shrinks from X→Y" from a report or from memory — back it with a runnable per-PR loop (`for p in …; do gh pr view $p --json state --jq .state; done`) before relying on it; an unverified scope reduction silently drops still-open work.
- A scoped live-drive run actually merged the PR, but the local pipeline process later reports `RESUMABLE at merge_wait` after an operator interrupt; the public evidence should include both explicit GitHub merge proof and a post-merge dry-run reclassification showing the issue routes to `finished PASS`.
- You are about to justify "approve+merge, don't fix" for a BLOCKED-with-zero-failing-checks PR by inferring its review requirement from a commit title or another repo — query the TARGET repo's live ruleset (`gh api repos/<O>/<R>/branches/main/protection/required_pull_request_reviews --jq .required_approving_review_count`) before acting.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. SCAN — enumerate org repos with open PRs (dynamic, guard empty = rate limit)
REPOS=($(gh repo list HomericIntelligence --json name,isArchived \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.isArchived==false) | select(.name|test("Odysseus";"i")|not) | .name][]'))
[[ ${#REPOS[@]} -eq 0 ]] && { echo "ERROR: empty repo list — GraphQL rate limit"; exit 1; }

# 2. DRIVE — per repo, sequential-within-repo merge; parallelize ACROSS repos only
#    haiku=clean merges, sonnet=conflicts/CI fixes, opus=orchestrator only

# 3. ARM auto-merge — squash org-wide (rebase-merge disabled on all 12 HI repos)
gh pr merge <PR#> --auto --squash --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo>

# 4. GATE "repo done" on LIVE open-PR count (NOT gh pr list --limit, which caps)
gh api --paginate "/repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls?state=open&per_page=100" | jq length

# 5. VERIFY report vs live state BEFORE reporting success
for r in "${REPOS[@]}"; do
  open=$(gh pr list --repo HomericIntelligence/$r --state open --json number --jq length)
  echo "$r live-open=$open"   # cross-check against the run's _summary.json
done
```

### Direct implementation review to merge (PR #2658)

For the queue pipeline, a successful implementation review does not have to create a
native GitHub approval review or inline thread. The loop-owned `state:implementation-go`
label is the durable authorization boundary; it is written only after the read-only
review, fresh head checks, and structural review facts pass. `merge_wait` then validates
the same reviewed head and the live repository merge requirements before conditionally
merging it. Verify the distinction directly:

```bash
repo=HomericIntelligence/ProjectHephaestus
pr=2658
gh api "repos/$repo/branches/main/protection/required_pull_request_reviews" \
  --jq '.required_approving_review_count'
gh pr view "$pr" --repo "$repo" \
  --json headRefOid,reviews,labels,statusCheckRollup,mergedAt,mergeCommit
gh pr checks "$pr" --repo "$repo" --required
gh api "repos/$repo/issues/$pr/timeline" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | {event,created_at,label:(.label.name // null),commit_id:(.commit_id // null)}'
```

The observed order for #2658 was: no native review/comments, `state:implementation-go`,
passing check runs, merge commit, then PR close and head-branch deletion. A PR body note
that the automation pipeline did not run tests is not a CI verdict; read the live check
results and target-repository review rules before reporting the merge outcome.

Direct pipeline explicit scopes must stay repo-scoped end-to-end:

```python
# In coordinator seeding / explicit-scope dispatch paths:
gh = stage_github_for(target_repo)  # or PipelineGitHub.for_repo(target_repo)
issue_state = gh.seed_issue_from_github(issue_number)
has_impl_state = gh.pr_has_implementation_state_label(pr_number)

# Regression tests should poison ambient helpers so accidental current-repo calls fail.
monkeypatch.setattr(module_under_test, "seed_issue", fail_if_called)
monkeypatch.setattr(module_under_test, "gh_pr_label_names", fail_if_called)

queued = coordinator.queue_explicit_targets(repo=target_repo, issues=[issue_number])
assert queued[0].repo == target_repo
```

Direct PR seeds must terminalize before branch adoption:

```python
outcome = _terminal_pr_outcome(gh.pr_state(pr_number))
if outcome is not None:
    return outcome

head_branch = gh.get_pr_head_branch(pr_number)
worktree = adopt_or_create_worktree(head_branch)
```

Use one shared helper for the terminal decision:

```python
def _terminal_pr_outcome(pr_state: Mapping[str, Any] | None) -> StageOutcome | None:
    if pr_state is None:
        return None
    state = str(pr_state.get("state") or "").upper()
    if state == "MERGED" or pr_state.get("mergedAt"):
        return PASS
    if state == "CLOSED":
        return FAIL
    return None
```

Re-verifying a STALE completed-sweep report at PLAN time (cheap live-state checks):

```bash
# A. Drop already-resolved flagged PRs: most are MERGED/CLOSED weeks later
gh pr view <N> --repo <O>/<R> --json state,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup

# B. BLOCKED classification: all required contexts SUCCESS yet BLOCKED ⇒ review/branch-protection
#    gate ⇒ approve+merge, NOT a CI fix
gh api repos/<O>/<R>/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks --jq .contexts

# C. "Stale lockfile format-version" claim — decode + grep instead of trusting the report
gh api repos/<O>/<R>/contents/pixi.lock?ref=<BRANCH> --jq .content | base64 -d | grep -m1 '^version:'

# D. "Remove file X" prescription already landed? 404 ⇒ already gone (check branch .gitignore too)
gh api repos/<O>/<R>/contents/<file>?ref=<BRANCH>   # 404 ⇒ removed

# E. Root-cause WORKFLOW defect gone? grep the LIVE workflow files at HEAD, not the report snippet
gh api repos/<O>/<R>/contents/.github/workflows?ref=<BRANCH> --jq '.[].name'   # then grep each
```

End-to-end per-PR iteration in the driver (the four compounding guards):

```python
def drive_one_pr(worktree, pr_head_branch) -> bool:
    sync_worktree_to_remote_branch(worktree, pr_head_branch)        # G1: pre-sync to origin/<head>
    pre = run(["git","rev-parse","HEAD"], cwd=worktree).stdout.strip()
    run_agent_session(worktree, pr_head_branch)
    post = run(["git","rev-parse","HEAD"], cwd=worktree).stdout.strip()
    if post == pre:                                                 # G2: no-commit guard
        logger.warning("no new commit (HEAD %s); skipping push", pre[:8]); return False
    push_current_branch_with_lease_on_divergence(                  # G3: explicit refspec
        worktree, branch=pr_head_branch, push_ref=f"HEAD:{pr_head_branch}")
    return True
# G4: gate repo-done on gh api --paginate .../pulls?state=open returning 0.
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Honest CI-driver success path (drive-prs-green silent no-op detection)

A driver that reports `pushed CI fixes for PR #N` while the remote PR head SHA is
unchanged is silently no-op'ing. Three compounding bugs cause it; apply all four
guards in order (each catches what the next cannot):

1. **Pre-sync the worktree to `origin/<pr-head>` BEFORE the agent runs.** A local-branch-only
   `git rev-parse --verify` check falls through to `git worktree add -b <branch> ... main` on a
   clean clone, creating a NEW branch off `main` and ignoring `origin/<branch>`. Hard-reset:
   `git fetch origin <branch> && git reset --hard origin/<branch>` (safe — worktree is throwaway).
2. **Snapshot HEAD pre/post agent; `pre == post` ⇒ hard-fail the iteration.** Agent return is NOT
   proof of work (it may have resumed an old transcript and correctly decided nothing was needed).
3. **Push with explicit refspec `HEAD:<pr-head-branch>`, never bare `HEAD`.** Bare `git push origin
   HEAD` lands on whatever stray branch the agent checked out. Preserve the refspec through the
   `--force-with-lease=<branch>` retry.
4. **Gate "repo done" on `gh api --paginate /repos/<o>/<n>/pulls?state=open&per_page=100` == 0** —
   not `gh pr list --limit 100` (silent cap). Per-issue success ≠ repo cleanliness.

**Wait for the terminal state (v1.1.0+).** An armed-and-merging PR is NOT a failure. Do not exit
`rc=1` on any open PR. `_wait_for_pr_terminal(issue, pr)` polls `MERGED|CLOSED|FAILING|DIRTY|BLOCKED|TIMEOUT`
with exponential backoff capped 60s, bounded by `HEPH_PR_MERGE_MAX_WAIT` (default 1800s); a required
check concluding `failure` returns `FAILING` immediately. Partition still-open PRs: truthy
`autoMergeRequest` ⇒ `armed_pending` (WARNING, not failure); falsy ⇒ `needs_action` ⇒ `rc=1`.

**BLOCKED early-exit (v1.3.0 / PR #1090 closes #1088).** `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED` has two causes:
(a) branch-protection gate (e.g. unresolved required review threads) — **never self-heals**, the driver
will timeout in 30 min; and (b) required CI checks still in-flight — **transient, must keep polling**.
GitHub uses `BLOCKED` for BOTH causes, so a naive early-exit on `BLOCKED + not failing` is wrong when
checks are still pending. The correct guard:

```python
if merge_status == "BLOCKED":
    failing = self._failing_required_check_names(pr_number)
    if not failing:
        pending = self._pending_required_check_names(pr_number)
        if not pending:
            # All required checks concluded green but still BLOCKED →
            # definite branch-protection gate (unresolved threads etc.).
            # Leave armed and exit early — nothing the driver can fix.
            logger.warning(
                "PR #%d BLOCKED by branch-protection gate (0 failing, 0 pending required checks);"
                " leaving armed and exiting poll early",
                pr_number,
            )
            return "BLOCKED"
        # pending checks exist — keep polling (transient BLOCKED)
    # failing checks exist — keep polling (will return FAILING on conclusion)
```

`_pending_required_check_names` checks `c.get("status") != "completed"` for required checks (complement
of `_failing_required_check_names` which checks `conclusion == "failure"`). Handle `"BLOCKED"` in
callers: `_drive_issue` ⇒ `WorkerResult(success=True, pr_number=pr_number)` (leave armed, nothing to
fix); `_check_arming_on_drive_start` ⇒ same as `TIMEOUT` (leave armed, return success).

**Re-arm after a fix, survive concurrency, resolve DIRTY, never self-inflict lint (v1.2.0).**
After a fix returns `fixed=True`, re-enter check→arm→wait ONCE (`_recheck_and_arm_after_fix`) — a
fix re-triggers CI and the now-green PR otherwise sits CLEAN-but-unarmed forever. Wrap the
deterministic-uuid5 `--session-id` resume in try/except (3× backoff) then fall back to a fresh
`uuid4` so a collision under parallel workers is never terminal. Add `mergeStateStatus` to
`_gh_pr_state`, return `"DIRTY"` and run `_resolve_dirty_pr` (mechanical rebase → agent conflict
prompt). The force-engagement prompt FORBIDS committing a blocker file (use a `BLOCKED:` line) and
requires every edited file to pass the repo's own linters with NO rule disabled — and avoids
committing to bot PRs (a commit orphans a Dependabot PR; recovery is `@dependabot recreate`).

**Direct pipeline explicit scopes must not read from the ambient current repo (v1.5.0 / PR #1854 closes #1818).**
Direct pipeline entry points that accept explicit target scopes (`--issues`, `--prs`) are cross-repo by
contract. The coordinator must not seed state or classify PR labels through helper functions that infer the
current repository from CWD, git config, or a default GitHub client. Resolve a per-target-repo accessor at
the boundary and keep using it through seeding, label checks, queue construction, and evidence generation:

```python
for target in explicit_targets:
    gh = self.pipeline_github.for_repo(target.repo)
    issue = gh.seed_issue_from_github(target.issue_number)
    labels = gh.pr_has_implementation_state_label(target.pr_number)
    self.queue.append(QueuedTarget(repo=target.repo, issue=issue, has_impl_state=labels))
```

The regression shape is load-bearing: patch the ambient helpers to fail, then assert the queued work keeps
the target repo. A test that only patches the repo-scoped accessor can pass while the production code still
leaks through the ambient path. Poison both common escape hatches:

```python
def fail_if_called(*args, **kwargs):
    raise AssertionError("ambient current-repo GitHub helper was called")

monkeypatch.setattr(coordinator_module, "seed_issue", fail_if_called)
monkeypatch.setattr(coordinator_module, "gh_pr_label_names", fail_if_called)

queued = coordinator.seed_explicit_scope(repo="HomericIntelligence/TargetRepo", issues=[1818])
assert [item.repo for item in queued] == ["HomericIntelligence/TargetRepo"]
```

When the live scoped drive merges the PR but the local process is interrupted and later prints
`RESUMABLE at merge_wait`, do not report that local state alone. Attach two pieces of evidence: (1) live
GitHub proof that the PR is merged at the expected head, and (2) a post-merge dry-run reclassification that
routes the issue to `finished PASS`. This distinguishes a successful merge from an incomplete local
checkpoint.

**Direct PR seeds must terminalize before branch adoption (v1.6.0 / PR #2024 closes #2023).**
Direct PR targets (`--prs ...`) can reach the pipeline after GitHub has already merged or closed the PR.
The bug pattern is subtle: the pipeline treats the target as still actionable, calls `get_pr_head_branch`,
tries to adopt or create a worktree for a branch GitHub may have deleted, and then records a failed attempt
after the real external outcome was already terminal.

Centralize the decision in `hephaestus/automation/pipeline/stages/base.py::_terminal_pr_outcome` and call it
before any branch-dependent work in all direct-PR entry points:

1. Coordinator direct PR seeding: terminalize already-merged or closed direct PR seeds before branch adoption.
2. CI stage: check the terminal outcome before `get_pr_head_branch` or worktree adoption.
3. Implementation stage: check the terminal outcome before head-branch lookup or implementation-label routing.

The helper contract is intentionally small:

- `state == "MERGED"` is PASS.
- Truthy `mergedAt` is PASS even if the state field is stale or shaped differently.
- `state == "CLOSED"` is FAIL.
- `None` or any nonterminal/open state returns `None` so normal routing continues.

Final status must be based on the latest effective logical item, not every historical attempt. Use
`latest_logical_items()` for final summaries, preserved-worktree guidance, and exit-code calculation. A stale
failed attempt for direct PR #N should not poison a later PASS for the same logical PR. Preserved-worktree
cleanup guidance should also filter stale or nonexistent entries before telling the operator what remains.

**A `--issues`-scoped drive-green run must touch ONLY those issues' PRs (v1.2.0 / PR #1110).**
When an operator scopes a `ci_driver` run with `--issues N1,N2`, the run must not over-reach into the
rest of the repo. The failing-PR discovery path was ALREADY correctly gated on `if not self.options.issues:`
(#819), but two other paths leaked repo-wide work into a scoped run and had to be fixed to mirror it:

1. **Bot-PR discovery is default-ON** (`--include-bot-prs`, default on, #848). A scoped `--issues 725,711`
   run still ran `_discover_bot_prs()` and pulled in an unrelated Dependabot PR (#1032):
   `Found 3 PR(s) to drive: {725:996, 711:997, 1032:1032}`. Gate it the same way as failing-PR discovery —
   the no-args backlog sweep keeps bot PRs, a scoped run does not:

   ```python
   if self.options.include_bot_prs and not self.options.issues:
       ...  # only discover bot PRs on the UNSCOPED backlog sweep
   ```

2. **The repo-done gate + `_arm_all_unarmed_open_prs` scanned ALL open PRs.** `_list_open_prs_remaining()`
   returns the FULL paginated open-PR set (#838), so a scoped run armed unrelated PRs and failed
   `rc=1` with `"Repo not done: 59 open PR(s) need manual action"` — for PRs the operator never selected.
   In `run()`, after building `self.open_prs_remaining`, FILTER it to only the PRs this run drove
   (`pr_map.values()`) when scoped, so the done-gate and arming consider only scoped PRs; the unscoped
   sweep keeps full repo-wide behavior:

   ```python
   if self.options.issues and self.open_prs_remaining:
       scoped = set(pr_map.values())
       self.open_prs_remaining = [pr for pr in self.open_prs_remaining if pr.get("number") in scoped]
   ```

The plan + implement phases already scope correctly (the loop passes the discovered issue list via
`--issues`); only drive-green over-reached. A scoped validation run (`--issues 725,711`) is the right way
to test one or two PRs without driving the whole backlog. Tests that asserted bot PRs union even when
`--issues` is set were asserting the BUG — flip them to assert the union only on the UNSCOPED path
(clear `options.issues=[]`).

#### Report-vs-live-state verification

Automation summaries are observation reports, not ground truth. `Driven: 8` only means the driver
was invoked, not that PRs reached green. NEVER report success from `_summary.json` alone — cross-check
live GitHub state per repo first:

1. Read the summary, then suspect every field (banner counts derive from rc codes set by gates that
   fire on noise).
2. For every "Driven" repo, `gh pr list --repo <o>/<r> --state open` — non-zero live count while the
   log says `Found 0 PR(s) to drive` ⇒ architecturally blind (PRs without `Closes #<open-issue>`,
   e.g. Dependabot, are invisible to issue-driven discovery).
3. For every claimed-pushed PR, confirm the head commit landed inside the run window:
   `gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid,commits`.
4. For every "Failed" repo, classify: done-gate-on-noise / architecturally-blind / no-new-commit /
   real-crash. Only a real push-fail-or-crash warrants escalation. A "Failed" repo can have shipped a
   merged fix (one session: `Telemachy #246` MERGED 29s after it was reported failed).
5. Deliver the Reality-vs-Claim table, not the banner.

#### Planning against a STALE completed-sweep / status-report issue (re-verify before trusting)

The report-vs-live-state rule applies just as hard at PLAN time as at drive time. A myrmidon
"open-PR health + auto-fix sweep" issue is a SNAPSHOT report: it lists "flagged for human" PRs with
stated root causes, and is often marked COMPLETED. Re-planning that issue weeks later, **every action
item and every root cause is suspect** — re-verify each flagged PR's LIVE state before writing any
plan step. In one session (Odysseus #299, report dated 2026-05-31, re-planned 2026-06-20, 20 days
later): of ~13 "flagged for human" PRs, MOST were already MERGED; only 7 remained open, and the report's
stated root causes for the survivors had all gone stale. The reusable triage:

1. **`gh pr view <N> --json state,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup` every flagged PR first.**
   Most are already MERGED/CLOSED — drop them from the plan before doing anything else.

2. **Classify each still-open BLOCKED PR by its required-check state (PLAN-time analogue of the driver's
   v1.3.0 early-exit).** `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED` with ZERO failing AND zero pending required checks =
   a branch-protection / review gate → the action is **approve+merge, NOT a CI fix**. BLOCKED with
   failing/pending required checks = real CI work. Confirm by comparing the rollup to the required
   contexts:

   ```bash
   # required contexts the branch enforces
   gh api repos/<O>/<R>/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks --jq .contexts
   # this PR's check conclusions — if every required context is SUCCESS yet state is BLOCKED,
   # the blocker is a review/branch-protection gate, not CI
   gh pr view <N> --json mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup
   ```

   Evidence: 4 Scylla dependabot PRs had all 17 checks SUCCESS but were BLOCKED — by a newly-added
   1-approving-review rule (Odysseus commit d34e291) — so the action was approve+merge, not "fix CI".

3. **Verify a "stale lockfile / format-version" root-cause claim cheaply** by decoding the file at the
   relevant refs and grepping the version, instead of trusting the report's quoted version:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/<O>/<R>/contents/pixi.lock?ref=<BRANCH> --jq .content | base64 -d | grep -m1 '^version:'
   ```

   Evidence: the report's "Scylla pixi.lock format-v7 vs CI max-v6" root cause was GONE — both `main`
   and the dependabot branches returned `version: 6`.

4. **Confirm a prescribed fix hasn't ALREADY landed.** A `404` on the file the report says to "remove"
   means it is already gone; also check the branch `.gitignore`:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/<O>/<R>/contents/<file>?ref=<BRANCH>   # 404 ⇒ already removed
   ```

   Evidence: Nestor #103's prescribed fix ("remove `CMakeUserPresets.json`, gitignore it") had already
   landed (404 on the file at `ref=12-impl`; entry present in the branch `.gitignore`). The remaining
   blocker was purely DIRTY/CONFLICTING with 0 failing checks → action became **rebase**, not the
   report's fix. Several AchaeanFleet PRs (#691) similarly just needed a rebase to pick up fixes already
   on `main`.

5. **Confirm a root-cause WORKFLOW DEFECT is gone by grepping the live workflow files at HEAD**, not the
   report's quoted snippet. Evidence: the "codebuff tmpfs-noexec" root cause was gone — a grep of all
   workflows for `tmpfs|/home/agent/.config|codebuff` found no `--tmpfs …:noexec` mount and no smoke-test
   step. Also watch for the blocker-file anti-pattern in survivors (AchaeanFleet #683 carried a stray
   committed `.github/CI_FIX_683.md` plus a conflict).

6. **The report's ROOT CAUSE can be WRONG, not merely stale — even for a PR that is STILL FAILING
   (v1.4.0).** Steps 1-5 above catch causes that have *gone away* (the fix already landed, the file is
   removed, the version bumped). This rule is stronger: a report can be correct that a PR is red while
   being flat WRONG about *why*. A still-failing PR is NOT evidence that the report's diagnosis holds.
   Before writing a fix that targets a report-named file/line, do BOTH:
   (a) READ that file at the PR's ref, and (b) pull the LATEST failing CI log — never plan from the
   report's causal sentence alone.

   ```bash
   # (a) read the named file at the PR's branch — does the claimed defect even exist there?
   gh api repos/<O>/<R>/contents/<file>?ref=<BRANCH> --jq .content | base64 -d | sed -n '40,50p'
   # (b) read the LATEST failing run for the branch — what step actually fails NOW?
   run_id=$(gh run list --repo <O>/<R> --branch <BRANCH> --json databaseId,conclusion \
     --jq '[.[]|select(.conclusion=="failure")][0].databaseId')
   gh run view "$run_id" --repo <O>/<R> --log-failed | tail -60
   ```

   **Worked example — Keystone #568 (ProjectKeystone, branch `501-impl`, R1 re-plan 2026-06-19).**
   The report's diagnosis: *"container name built from empty `GIT_COMMIT`/`BUILD_UID`/`BUILD_GID` →
   `projectkeystone-dev-`; `podman-compose exec` fails."* Prescribed fix: *"populate the envvars in the
   workflow."* Reading the branch DISPROVED BOTH halves:
   - `docker-compose.yml:45` → `container_name: projectkeystone-dev` is a STATIC literal — there is no
     `${GIT_COMMIT}` interpolation, so it can never produce a trailing-dash name. The "empty-var name"
     story is fiction.
   - `.github/actions/install-build-deps/action.yml:106-110` ALREADY exports all three
     (`GIT_COMMIT=${{ github.sha }}`, `BUILD_UID=$(id -u)`, `BUILD_GID=$(id -g)`) into `$GITHUB_ENV`
     BEFORE `podman-compose up -d dev` at `action.yml:138`. The prescribed fix was already done.

   The ACTUAL current cause, from the live failing run (`gh run view 27831294048 --log-failed`, 2026-06-19):
   `action.yml:97` runs `sudo apt-get install -y "podman=${PODMAN_APT_VERSION}" podman-compose` → exit 100
   (*"has no installation candidate"*) → cascades to exit 127. `podman-version.env:1` pins
   `PODMAN_APT_VERSION=5.0.2+ds1-4ubuntu1`, which is no longer present in the `ubuntu-24.04` runner image
   (release 20260615). All 5 failing checks (benchmarks, NATS integration, lint, coverage×2) share that one
   setup-step failure. The real fix: re-pin to a runner-available podman version (discover via
   `apt-cache madison podman` on the matching image) or drop the exact `=${VERSION}` pin. **NOTE: this fix
   VALUE is UNVERIFIED — the exact replacement version was not pinned down; the DIAGNOSIS (failing log read)
   is verified-local, the FIX is deferred to an implementer.**

7. **Lock a scope-reduction claim with evidence; never assert it (v1.4.0).** When re-planning a stale
   multi-PR sweep, the "these N already merged, so scope shrinks X→Y" claim must be backed by a runnable
   loop, not memory:

   ```bash
   for p in <PR numbers>; do echo -n "#$p "; gh pr view "$p" --repo <O>/<R> --json state --jq .state; done
   ```

   Evidence: 16 PRs confirmed MERGED this way. An unverified scope reduction silently drops still-open work.

8. **Confirm a branch-protection / required-review gate against the LIVE ruleset, not an inference from a
   commit title (v1.4.0).** "Approve+merge, don't fix" for a BLOCKED-with-zero-failing-checks PR is only
   justified once the TARGET repo's review requirement is confirmed directly:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/<O>/<R>/branches/main/protection/required_pull_request_reviews \
     --jq .required_approving_review_count
   ```

   Evidence: Scylla's `1` (ruleset `homeric-main-baseline`, active) was CONFIRMED this way after the reviewer
   flagged that R1 had INFERRED it from Odysseus commit title `d34e291` — an inference that may not apply to
   the target repo at all.

**Known gaps when re-planning from a report (record these in the plan honestly).** The cheap live-state
DISCOVERY/triage above is verified-local — the queries were run and observed. But a re-plan's prescribed
FIXES are unverified hypotheses until executed. Mark them as such.

The R1 re-plan ITSELF seeded three of these gaps and got a NOGO from the plan reviewer; the R2 revision
closed two by reading files at the ref / live logs (see steps 6-8 above) and recorded the third honestly:

- **CLOSED (was the biggest miss): the Keystone #568 fix.** R1 wrote a "populate
  `GIT_COMMIT`/`BUILD_UID`/`BUILD_GID` in `_required.yml`" fix straight from the report WITHOUT opening the
  `docker-compose.yml` name template or the `podman-compose up` action. Reading the branch in R2 showed the
  report's root cause was WRONG (static `container_name`, envvars already exported) and the real cause was an
  unavailable pinned podman apt version — see the worked example in step 6. The DIAGNOSIS is now verified-local;
  the exact replacement podman version is STILL a gap (deferred to an implementer running
  `apt-cache madison podman` on the matching runner image).
- **CLOSED: "Scylla requires 1 approving review."** R1 INFERRED this from Odysseus commit title `d34e291`;
  the reviewer flagged it; R2 confirmed `required_approving_review_count = 1` against Scylla's live ruleset
  `homeric-main-baseline` (see step 8).
- **STILL OPEN: Dependabot rebase mechanics** (`@dependabot rebase` vs manual force-push) were acknowledged
  but not tested live.

#### Hephaestus loop deadlocks (drive-green discovery + labeling)

Two complementary deadlocks keep `hephaestus-automation-loop` from driving PRs to green:

**(A) drive-green discovery (NOT shipped — use the bypass).** `--phases drive-green --loops N>1` is
structurally unreachable (the not-final-loop gate + zero-work early-exit). `--loops 1` prints
`SKIP (no open issues)` because discovery walks `@me`-scoped open issues, not failing PRs. Bypass:

```bash
cd /home/<you>/Projects/<repo>
issues=$(gh pr list --state open --json number,body,statusCheckRollup --limit 200 --jq '
  .[] | select((.statusCheckRollup//[])|map(.conclusion)|any(.=="FAILURE" or .=="CANCELLED" or .=="TIMED_OUT"))
      | .body | capture("Closes #(?<n>[0-9]+)").n' | sort -u)
pixi run python /home/<you>/Projects/ProjectHephaestus/scripts/drive_prs_green.py \
  --issues $issues --force-run   # --force-run / HEPH_CI_DRIVER_FORCE=1 escapes the HEPH_LOOP_INDEX gate
```

Filed as #818-#821 (phase model / PR-based discovery / optional `--issues` / `--all` for non-`@me`).

**(B) existing-PR labeling deadlock (SHIPPED FIX).** `state:implementation-go` is added in exactly
one place (`mark_pr_implementation_go`, after the in-loop review). But `_implement_issue`
hard-returned early on existing PRs (the "skip existing PRs" shortcut), so they were never reviewed
→ never labeled → `ci_driver.py` gates (:330/:627/:965) refused to arm → green-but-unmergeable forever
(9 PRs observed). Fix: replace the skip with `sync_worktree_to_remote_branch` (hard-reset is the
anti-clobber mechanism), let existing PRs enter the review→address loop, gate idempotency on the
TERMINAL GO/NO-GO label. Shipped as PRs #1073/#1075/#1077/#1079. Load-bearing facts: sessions resume
by deterministic uuid5 of `(repo, issue, agent)` (NOT the persisted `session_id` — `state-{n}.json`
vs `issue-{n}.json` path bug was invisible for Claude, broke Codex); the only way to re-raise a
resolved review thread is a NEW inline thread (no GitHub "unresolve" mutation).

#### Swarm orchestration across 3+ repos

Use a myrmidon swarm with wave/phase ordering; **sequential within a repo, parallel across repos**:

- **Phase 1 Scan** (opus): enumerate org repos, classify each PR MERGEABLE / DIRTY / BLOCKED / Dependabot.
- **Phase 2 Wave 1** (haiku, one per repo): merge clean PRs oldest-first. **Cap 5 merges/repo/pass** —
  each merge advances `main` and cascades downstream branches to DIRTY; rescan + rebase before continuing.
- **Phase 3 Wave 1b** (sonnet): rebase conflicts (`git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main &&
  git push --force-with-lease`). At scale ~15-20% of DIRTY PRs are subsumed (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`
  empty) — close, don't rebase. `BLOCKED` + empty `statusCheckRollup` = CI not started yet (transient,
  wait 60s). Under Safety Net, replace `git restore --theirs` with `git show MERGE_HEAD:<path> > <path>`.
- **Phase 4 Wave 1c** (sonnet): read CI logs, fix, push, poll to green, merge.
- **Phase 5 Wave 2** (sonnet): update Odysseus submodule pins ONLY after every repo's open PRs are
  merged; never pin to a stale feature-branch SHA (`git branch -r --contains HEAD`).
- Detect auto-merge support per repo (`gh api repos/<o>/<r> --jq .allow_auto_merge`); on repos with it
  disabled use direct `--rebase`, never `--auto --rebase` (GraphQL error). For automation loops, resolve
  Python via `pixi run which python`, export `PYTHONPATH`, guard empty repo list = rate limit.

**Direct Agent fan-out** when the parent already planned: write the brief once to
`~/.tmp/<topic>-brief.md`, dispatch short pointer-prompts per repo (~30K parent-token savings for a
14-agent dispatch) instead of re-invoking `/hephaestus:myrmidon-swarm` (which re-runs Phase 1).

#### Ecosystem-wide and org-wide sweeps

- **Ecosystem sweep**: Phase-0 parallel classifier swarm (one agent/repo, {EASY,MEDIUM,HARD,META,
  ALREADY_DONE}) → manual close-batch (NEVER close blindly; `gh issue view N` first) → wave (PR-per-issue,
  cap ~20) or bundle (bundle-PR-per-repo, cap 10 issues) → CVE unblock → rebase cascade → CI triage.
  Every wave-agent prompt: `git fetch && git rebase origin/main` first, a stale-check pre-action, a
  PRECOMMIT_STALL abort (>60s ⇒ `SKIP=...` or `--no-verify`), a COVERAGE-DELTA guard, `--auto --squash`.
  Phase-0 ALREADY_DONE is advisory (misses ~15%); always add a per-agent stale-check. For Phase-4
  rebase cascades use a SEQUENTIAL loop in fresh worktrees (never parallelize rebase against one clone);
  `:2:file` = upstream during rebase (ours/theirs inverted). Parallel `--admin` merge against one base
  hits the GraphQL stale-base race (~24% at concurrency 5) — drain sequentially.
- **Org-wide planned-issue swarm**: the "has a plan" signal is a `# Implementation Plan` issue COMMENT,
  not the `planning` label. Pre-warm gpg-agent once at session start. Dispatcher sub-agents do read-only
  TRIAGE only (sub-agents have no Agent/Task tool); **L0 fans out the implementers itself in waves**
  (`run_in_background`, `isolation: worktree`, `model: sonnet`, branch from fresh `origin/main`). One
  signed (`-S`) auto-merge PR per issue with `Closes #<N>` on its own line, `--auto --squash`. Dedup
  via closing-keyword regex on open PR bodies, NOT `--search "in:body #N"` (substring false positives:
  `#4` matches `#44`). Verify signatures via REST `gh api .../commits/<sha> --jq .commit.verification.verified`
  (GraphQL lags). Implementers EXECUTE the plan but RECONCILE divergences (plans predate refactors).

#### Batch review-plan pipeline

Bulk-process automated `review-plan-*.md` + `review-*.json` (`phase=failed`) across stale PR branches:

1. **Triage**: for each `review-*.json`, read `phase` / `pr_number` / `error`; cross-reference PR state.
   `failed`+OPEN ⇒ process; `failed`+MERGED+CI-flake ⇒ skip; `completed` ⇒ skip.
2. **Check for unpushed local fix commits** first: `git -C <wt> rev-list --count origin/<branch>..HEAD`
   — many worktrees already have a fix commit (the push is what failed); just rebase + push.
3. **Repair corrupted files** from the `git add EADME.md` typo bug: `git checkout -- README.md
   docs/dev/release-process.md`.
4. **Create missing worktrees, bulk-rebase onto `origin/main`, push `--force-with-lease`.** On conflict,
   detect real markers with line-anchored grep `^<<<<<<` (YAML `=====` echo lines are NOT markers).
5. **Enable auto-merge** on all fixed PRs and verify state + `autoMergeRequest` presence.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Bare `git push origin HEAD` after the agent returns | Pushed HEAD bare, logged success on `rc==0` | Agent had checked out a stray `<issue>-fix-ci` branch; push landed there, PR head unchanged | Always pass explicit refspec `HEAD:<pr-head>` and preserve it through the force-with-lease retry |
| Trust worktree-create to land on the PR head | Local-branch-only `git rev-parse --verify` check | Fell through to `git worktree add -b <branch> ... main`, creating a new branch off main, ignoring `origin/<branch>` | Driver MUST `fetch origin <branch>` + `reset --hard origin/<branch>` before the agent runs |
| Skip the no-commit guard, push whatever HEAD points to | Assumed "agent returned ⇒ did work ⇒ safe to push" | Agent resumed an old transcript, returned in seconds with no commit; force-with-lease exited 0 (HEAD==remote) | Snapshot HEAD pre/post; `pre==post` is a hard iteration failure — skip the push |
| Treat per-issue success as "repo done" | Printed "Driven: ProjectX" when every input issue returned success | PRs outside the input list (Dependabot, auto-merge-waiting) sat open while the script reported done | Gate repo-done on `gh api --paginate .../pulls?state=open` == 0, not `gh pr list --limit` (silent cap) |
| Exit `rc=1` on ANY open PR (including armed-and-merging) | Blunt done-gate marked 7/15 repos FAILED while every PR was armed and merging | Driver observed-and-returned instead of waiting for the real outcome | Partition open PRs: truthy `autoMergeRequest` ⇒ WARNING; falsy ⇒ `rc=1`; add `_wait_for_pr_terminal` |
| Return success the instant a fix lands | `_attempt_ci_fixes` returned on `fixed=True`, never re-arming | The fix re-triggers CI; the now-green PR sat CLEAN but auto-merge un-armed forever | Re-enter check→arm→wait once via `_recheck_and_arm_after_fix`; mock it in tests too |
| Leave the `--session-id` resume fallback unguarded | Deterministic uuid5 id, unguarded resume on create-collision | Two parallel workers raced before the transcript JSONL was on disk; the error killed the drive | Wrap resume in try/except (3× backoff), then fall back to a fresh `uuid4` so a collision is never terminal |
| Wait out TIMEOUT for a DIRTY armed PR | `_gh_pr_state` fetched no `mergeStateStatus` | Could not tell pending from conflicted; waited the full 1800s every run forever | Add `mergeStateStatus`, return `"DIRTY"`, run `_resolve_dirty_pr` (rebase → agent conflict prompt) |
| BLOCKED early-exit guarded only by `not failing` (v1.3.0) | Added early-exit on `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED` when `_failing_required_check_names` returns empty — no pending check | GitHub reports `BLOCKED` for both (a) branch-protection gates (unresolved threads — never self-heals) AND (b) required checks still in-flight (transient — must keep polling). Guard on `not failing` alone exits early while CI is still running, abandoning a PR that would have self-healed | Guard on BOTH: `not failing` AND `not pending` (`_pending_required_check_names` returns empty). Only then is BLOCKED definitively a branch-protection gate (all required checks concluded green). If either failing OR pending is non-empty, keep polling. |
| Tell the agent to commit a blocker file | Prompt said "commit a file documenting the blocker" | The `CI_BLOCKER.md` itself failed markdownlint (turning one red check into two) and orphaned Dependabot PRs | Forbid the blocker file (use a `BLOCKED:` line); require every edited file lint-clean, no rule disabled |
| Trust the summary banner / `rc=0` | Reported from `_summary.json` (`Driven 8 / Failed 4`) | "Driven" only means the driver was invoked; 7/8 had 0 in-scope PRs, 3/4 "Failed" were false | Cross-check live `gh pr list --state open` per repo before reporting; classify each failure mode |
| Plan directly from a completed-sweep report's action items | Took the ~13 "flagged for human" PRs and their stated root causes from a 20-day-old myrmidon sweep report (Odysseus #299) as the plan input | Most flagged PRs were already MERGED (only 7 still open) and every surviving root cause was stale (lockfile version, removed file, workflow mount) | Re-`gh pr view` every flagged PR FIRST; drop merged/closed ones; re-verify each root cause at live HEAD before planning any fix |
| Prescribe a "CI fix" for a BLOCKED PR at plan time | Saw `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED` and assumed CI work, as the report implied | 4 Scylla PRs had all 17 required checks SUCCESS but were BLOCKED only by a newly-added 1-approving-review rule — a CI fix would have been wasted effort | At plan time classify BLOCKED the same way the driver does: 0 failing AND 0 pending required checks ⇒ branch-protection/review gate ⇒ approve+merge, NOT a CI fix |
| Trust the report's "stale pixi.lock format-v7 vs CI v6" root cause | Believed the report's quoted lockfile format version | `base64 -d` of `pixi.lock` at `main` AND the dependabot branches returned `version: 6` on both — the root cause was already gone | Decode the file at the actual refs and grep the version (`gh api .../contents/pixi.lock?ref=B --jq .content \| base64 -d \| grep '^version:'`) instead of trusting the report |
| Plan the report's prescribed file-removal / workflow fix | Was about to plan "remove CMakeUserPresets.json + gitignore it" (Nestor #103) and "remove the tmpfs:noexec mount" (AchaeanFleet) | Both had ALREADY landed — the file 404'd at `ref=12-impl` and was in the branch `.gitignore`; grep of live workflows found no `--tmpfs …:noexec` mount | Confirm the fix hasn't shipped: `gh api .../contents/<file>?ref=B` (404 ⇒ removed), grep the LIVE workflow files at HEAD; the residual blocker was just a rebase, not the report's fix |
| Record report-seeded fixes as verified in the plan | Wrote the Keystone `_required.yml` env fix + "Scylla needs 1 review" + dependabot-rebase steps as if confirmed | The compose job/name-template were never opened (env keys + `BUILD_UID/GID=1000` guessed), the review rule was inferred from a commit title, and rebase mechanics were untested | Mark report-seeded prescribed fixes as UNVERIFIED hypotheses with a "Known gaps" note; only the live-state DISCOVERY queries were verified-local |
| Trust the stale report's ROOT CAUSE for a still-failing PR (v1.4.0) | R1 wrote a fix from the report's diagnosis ("empty `GIT_COMMIT`/`BUILD_UID`/`BUILD_GID` → bad container name; populate the envvars") for Keystone #568, reasoning that since the PR was genuinely red the report's cause must hold | Reading the branch DISPROVED both halves: `docker-compose.yml:45` `container_name: projectkeystone-dev` is a STATIC literal (no `${GIT_COMMIT}`), and `action.yml:106-110` ALREADY exports all three envvars before `podman-compose up`. The fix targeted an already-correct file; the REAL cause was an unavailable pinned podman apt version (`action.yml:97` / `podman-version.env:1`, exit 100→127 in run 27831294048) | A still-failing PR is NOT evidence the report's diagnosis is right — the cause can be WRONG, not just stale. Before targeting a report-named file/line, READ that file at the PR's ref AND `gh run view <id> --log-failed` the latest failing run |
| Assert a scope reduction without a per-PR state check (v1.4.0) | Claimed "these N already merged, so the sweep shrinks X→Y" from the report / from memory, without enumerating each PR's live state | An unverified scope reduction silently DROPS still-open work — a PR assumed merged may still be open and needing action | Back every "already merged" claim with a runnable loop: `for p in …; do gh pr view $p --json state --jq .state; done` (here 16 confirmed MERGED) before relying on the reduced scope |
| Infer a required-review gate from a commit title (v1.4.0) | Inferred "Scylla needs 1 approving review" (justifying approve+merge over fix) from Odysseus commit title `d34e291`, which mentioned a review-rule change | A commit title in one repo may not describe the TARGET repo's live ruleset; the reviewer flagged the inference | Query the target repo's live gate directly: `gh api repos/<O>/<R>/branches/main/protection/required_pull_request_reviews --jq .required_approving_review_count` (confirmed `1`, ruleset `homeric-main-baseline`) before justifying approve+merge |
| Seed explicit pipeline scopes through ambient helpers (v1.5.0) | Direct pipeline coordinator code accepted `--issues` / `--prs` for a target repo but called current-repo helpers such as `seed_issue` and `gh_pr_label_names` | In a multi-repo or non-target CWD run, state and labels can come from the wrong repository while tests still pass against the developer's current repo | Resolve a per-target-repo `StageGitHub` / `PipelineGitHub` accessor at the scope boundary, call `seed_issue_from_github` and `pr_has_implementation_state_label`, and write regression tests that patch ambient helpers to fail |
| Report `RESUMABLE at merge_wait` without live merge proof (v1.5.0) | After the scoped live-drive merged the PR, the local pipeline process was interrupted and later reported a resumable checkpoint at `merge_wait` | The local checkpoint describes the interrupted process, not the live repository outcome; by itself it under-reports a successful merge | Pair the local checkpoint with explicit GitHub merge proof and a post-merge dry-run reclassification showing the issue routes to `finished PASS` |
| Continue direct PR seeds after terminal GitHub state (v1.6.0) | Direct PR seeds that were already `MERGED` or `CLOSED` continued into `get_pr_head_branch`, worktree adoption, or implementation-label routing | GitHub may delete the head branch after merge, so branch-dependent recovery can fail after the PR already reached a terminal outcome | Query PR state first and centralize `_terminal_pr_outcome`: `MERGED` or truthy `mergedAt` => PASS, `CLOSED` => FAIL, `None`/open => continue |
| Compute final status over every historical attempt (v1.6.0) | Final summary, preserved-worktree guidance, and exit-code calculation considered stale failed attempts from the same direct PR after a later pass | Superseded failures kept the run red even when the latest logical item had passed | Use `latest_logical_items()` for effective final summaries, cleanup guidance, and exit-code calculation |
| Emit preserved-worktree cleanup advice from raw stale entries (v1.6.0) | Preserved-worktree guidance listed duplicate, stale, or nonexistent entries | Operators were told to inspect worktrees that no longer existed or no longer represented the latest logical outcome | Filter stale/nonexistent preserved-worktree entries before emitting cleanup guidance; track repo identity carefully when extending this filter |
| Treat `Testing: Not run by the automation pipeline` in a PR body as a failed merge gate (v1.7.0) | Read the generated PR description instead of the target repository's live check and review state | PR #2658 had no automation-run test claim, but its live check set passed and the target branch required zero approving reviews | Treat PR prose as context; verify `state:implementation-go`, exact-head evidence, live checks, and the target repository's required-review rule |
| `hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green --loops N` | Increased loop budget / set `--loops 1` | Not-final-loop gate + zero-work early-exit make N>1 unreachable; `--loops 1` discovers `@me` issues not PRs | Bypass via `drive_prs_green.py --issues <N> --force-run`; fix is PR-based discovery (#818-#821) |
| "Skip existing PRs to avoid clobbering" early-return | `_implement_issue` hard-returned before the review loop | Existing PRs never reviewed → never labeled `state:implementation-go` → never armed; 9 green PRs stuck | Replace the skip with `sync_worktree_to_remote_branch`; gate idempotency on the terminal label |
| Run drive-green with `--issues` but leave bot-PR discovery + the open-PR done/arming gate repo-wide | Scoped `--issues 725,711` but `_discover_bot_prs()` stayed default-ON and `_list_open_prs_remaining()` returned the full paginated open-PR set | Scoped run pulled in unrelated Dependabot PRs (e.g. #1032) and armed/failed `rc=1` on all 59 open PRs the operator never selected | Gate bot-PR discovery on `not options.issues` (mirror the #819 failing-PR gate) and filter the done-gate/arming to `pr_map.values()` when scoped; the unscoped sweep stays repo-wide |
| Parallel PR merges within one repo | Merged #4/#5/#6 in parallel on one base | #6 conflicted when #4/#5 advanced main | Merge sequentially within a repo (oldest-first); parallelize only across repos |
| Unlimited clean merges per wave | Tried to merge 39 CLEAN PRs in one pass | Each merge advanced main, cascading 24+ to DIRTY | Cap 5 merges/repo/pass; rescan + rebase before continuing |
| Parallel rebase / parallel `--admin` merge | One agent per branch / 5-concurrent admin merges on one base | Agents clobbered each other's checkout; admin merge hit GraphQL stale-base race (13/17 failed) | Sequential loop in fresh worktrees; `--admin` bypasses protection, not the mergeability race |
| `gh pr merge --auto --rebase` org-wide | Used the myrmidon-swarm template default | All 12 HI repos disable rebase-merge; `--rebase` silently never arms | Hardcode `--auto --squash`; verify `gh api repos/<o>/<r> --jq .allow_squash_merge` first |
| `Closes #N` in a markdown table / comma-list | Bundle PR body listed issues in a table / `closes #A, #B` | GitHub ignores closing keywords in tables; honors only the first in a comma-list | `Closes #A. Closes #B.` — one keyword per issue, period-separated, at the TOP of the body |
| Two-level swarm (dispatcher sub-agents spawn implementers) | Documented dispatcher→implementer two-level fan-out | Sub-agents have no Agent/Task tool at the second level | Dispatchers do read-only TRIAGE only; L0 fans out implementers itself in waves |
| `gh pr list --search "in:body #N"` for PR dedup | Substring search of open PR bodies | `#4` matched `#44`/`#42` — unrelated issues looked covered | Parse closing keywords with regex, flatten, unique |
| Trust GraphQL signature / Phase-0 ALREADY_DONE | Read GraphQL `signature.state`; trusted classifier buckets | GraphQL lags REST by minutes; classifiers miss ~15% ALREADY_DONE | Verify via REST `gh api .../commits/<sha>`; add a per-wave-agent stale-check |
| Push MERGED-PR fix commits / rebase without checking local state | Pushed per review-plan without checking PR state or unpushed commits | MERGED PRs can't receive pushes; many worktrees already had unpushed fix commits | Check PR state + `rev-list --count origin/<branch>..HEAD` before choosing rebase vs push |
| `grep -c "<<<<"` to detect conflict markers | Counted `=====` YAML echo lines as conflicts | YAML workflows use `=====` legitimately | Use line-anchored `grep -n "^<<<<<<"` |

## Results & Parameters

### Driver hardening (ProjectHephaestus, all merged to main)

| PR | Closes | What changed |
| ---- | -------- | -------------- |
| #833 | #832 | `sync_worktree_to_remote_branch` + `push_ref` refspec preserved through lease-retry |
| #837 | #836 | no-commit guard: compare `git rev-parse HEAD` pre/post agent, skip push if unchanged |
| #839 | #838 | repo-done gated on `gh api --paginate .../pulls?state=open` == 0 |
| #876 | — | v1.1.0: `_wait_for_pr_terminal`, robust Dependabot arming, honest exit-gate partition, bounded no-commit retry |
| #879 | #878 | v1.2.0: `_recheck_and_arm_after_fix`, guarded session-id resume → fresh uuid4, `mergeStateStatus`/`DIRTY`/`_resolve_dirty_pr`, lint-clean blocker prompt. Suite: 1011 passed |
| #1073/#1075/#1077/#1079 | #1072/#1074/#1076/#1078 | existing-PR review→label deadlock fix: enter review loop, origin-sync anti-clobber, session-path fix, review_validator, bot-thread resolve |
| #1090 | #1088 | v1.3.0: BLOCKED early-exit in `_wait_for_pr_terminal` — guarded by both `_failing_required_check_names` and new `_pending_required_check_names`; handle `"BLOCKED"` in `_drive_issue` and `_check_arming_on_drive_start` callers. Suite: 3402 passed. |
| #1110 | — | scope drive-green to `--issues`: gate bot-PR discovery on `include_bot_prs and not options.issues` (#848/#819); filter `open_prs_remaining` to `pr_map.values()` when scoped so the done-gate + `_arm_all_unarmed_open_prs` consider only scoped PRs. Full `ci_driver` suite green in CI; PR CLEAN/MERGEABLE. |
| #1854 | #1818 | direct pipeline explicit scopes (`--issues`, `--prs`) stay target-repo scoped: coordinator seeding resolves a per-target-repo `StageGitHub` / `PipelineGitHub` accessor and calls `seed_issue_from_github` / `pr_has_implementation_state_label`; regression tests poison ambient `seed_issue` / `gh_pr_label_names`; post-merge interrupted `merge_wait` evidence includes GitHub merge proof plus dry-run `finished PASS` reclassification. Final head `30287af`; Required Checks `28771968071` success, Test `28771968016` success, HOL Plugin Scanner `28771968083` success; local full automation suite 3237 passed, affected slice 190 passed. |
| #2024 | #2023 | direct PR terminalization: coordinator direct PR seeding, CI, and implementation call shared `_terminal_pr_outcome` before branch lookup/worktree adoption/implementation-label routing; `MERGED` or truthy `mergedAt` passes, `CLOSED` fails, nonterminal/`None` continues; final summary, preserved-worktree guidance, and exit code use `latest_logical_items()` so stale failed attempts do not poison later passes. Final head `2c8c95c9bfc5c17a96c1d8cbc13383fe4ba30076`; verified-local: targeted regressions 4 passed, touched pipeline suite 155 passed, direct loop rerun for PRs #2010/#2017 exited 0 with both PASS, full unit suite 5826 passed / 21 skipped / 84.06% coverage, direct mypy, ruff check, ruff format --check, and pre-commit passed. |

### Org merge policy (all 12 HomericIntelligence repos)

```json
{ "allow_rebase_merge": false, "allow_squash_merge": true, "allow_auto_merge": true, "required_approving_review_count": 0 }
```

A green PR with `--auto --squash` armed merges itself (CI required, 0 approvals).

### Direct implementation review evidence (PR #2658 / issue #2378)

The implementation review produced no native GitHub approval or inline thread. The
loop-owned label was applied at `05:17:26Z`, the live required-check query returned 12
passing entries, and the PR merged at `05:26:32Z` as
`4ed77c1b42586a6b558ebcb2389295b5f314931b`; the head branch was deleted afterward.
The target branch reported `required_approving_review_count=0`, so missing native review
metadata was expected and not evidence that the loop skipped review.

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| ProjectHephaestus | Direct implementation review to merge | PR #2658 / issue #2378: read-only review, no native approval/comments, `state:implementation-go`, 12 passing live check entries, zero required approvals, merge commit `4ed77c1b42586a6b558ebcb2389295b5f314931b`, and post-merge head deletion. verified-ci from live GitHub evidence. |
| ProjectHephaestus | Driver honest-success path | PRs #833/#837/#839 (guards) → #876 (wait-for-merge) → #879 (re-arm/concurrency/DIRTY/lint) → #1090 (BLOCKED early-exit closes #1088). Suite 3402 passed; verified-ci (mypy 320 files clean, ruff clean, all pre-commit hooks). |
| ProjectHephaestus | Scoped drive-green honors `--issues` | PR #1110: bot-PR discovery gated on `not options.issues` (mirror #819); `open_prs_remaining` filtered to `pr_map.values()` when scoped so the done-gate + arming consider only scoped PRs. Repro: `--issues 725,711` pulled in Dependabot #1032 and failed `rc=1` on all 59 open PRs before the fix. Full `ci_driver` suite green in CI; verified-ci. |
| ProjectHephaestus | Direct pipeline explicit scopes stay target-repo scoped | PR #1854 / issue #1818: coordinator seeding uses per-target-repo `StageGitHub` / `PipelineGitHub` accessors, tests poison ambient helpers, and interrupted post-merge `merge_wait` evidence is paired with GitHub merge proof plus dry-run `finished PASS`. Final head `30287af`; Required Checks `28771968071`, Test `28771968016`, and HOL Plugin Scanner `28771968083` succeeded; local full automation suite 3237 passed and affected slice 190 passed; verified-ci. |
| ProjectHephaestus | Direct PR terminalization | PR #2024 / issue #2023: direct PR seeds terminalize before branch adoption in coordinator seeding, CI, and implementation; `_terminal_pr_outcome` maps `MERGED`/truthy `mergedAt` to PASS and `CLOSED` to FAIL; `latest_logical_items()` drives final summary, preserved-worktree guidance, and exit code. Final head `2c8c95c9bfc5c17a96c1d8cbc13383fe4ba30076`; verified-local: 4 targeted regressions passed, touched pipeline suite 155 passed, direct PR loop rerun for #2010/#2017 exited 0 with both PASS, full unit suite 5826 passed / 21 skipped / 84.06% coverage, mypy, ruff check, ruff format --check, and pre-commit passed. Strict-review follow-ups filed: #2026 (`mergedAt`, duplicate preserved worktrees, direct `ItemKind.PR` supersession regressions), #2027 (architecture docs and `gh_pr_state` docstring), #2028 (preserve repo identity when filtering preserved worktrees). |
| ProjectHephaestus | Report-vs-live-state | Run `20260531T190615Z`: banner `Driven 8 / Failed 4` decomposed to 1 honest-idle + 7 architecturally-blind / 1 real-bug + 3 false-failures; honesty gaps merged as PR #849. `Telemachy #246` MERGED 29s after reported failed. |
| ProjectHephaestus | Loop deadlocks | drive-green discovery #818-#821 (NOT shipped, bypass verified live 2026-05-30); existing-PR labeling deadlock shipped as PRs #1073/#1075/#1077/#1079 (9 green PRs unblocked). |
| HomericIntelligence ecosystem | Swarm PR orchestration | 8 repos, 87 PRs merged + Odysseus pins (2026-04-19); 12-repo silent-failures sweep 17/18 auto-squash-merged (2026-05-10). |
| HomericIntelligence ecosystem | Ecosystem sweeps | v1: 5 repos, 717 issues classified, 51 PRs merged, 78 retired (2026-05-12); v2: 11 bundle PRs, 7 merged (2026-05-16); sequential rebase cleared 12 stuck PRs (2026-05-18). |
| 12 HomericIntelligence repos | Org-wide planned-issue swarm | 430 plan-carrying issues; ~51 piloted across 5 repos with signed squash-auto-merge PRs; L0-only fan-out + closing-keyword dedup + plan reconciliation (verified-local, 2026-05-29). |
| ProjectOdyssey | Batch review-plan pipeline | 24 failed review plans triaged; 14 OPEN PRs rebased/fixed/pushed with auto-merge, ~20-30 min (2026-03-06). |
| Odysseus meta-repo | Re-plan stale completed-sweep report (#299) | Report dated 2026-05-31 re-planned 2026-06-20 (20 days later). Live `gh pr view` showed ~13 "flagged for human" PRs were mostly already MERGED (Nestor #91/#95/#101/#102, Hermes #645, Odyssey #5471/#5488, AchaeanFleet #681/#682/#684-#690); only 7 remained open. Every surviving root cause was stale: Scylla "pixi.lock v7 vs v6" gone (`version: 6` on both refs); 4 Scylla PRs all-checks-SUCCESS but BLOCKED by a new 1-review rule (approve+merge, not CI fix); Nestor #103 fix already landed (file 404 + in `.gitignore`, residual = rebase); AchaeanFleet tmpfs:noexec mount gone from live workflows; #683 carried a stray committed `.github/CI_FIX_683.md`. Discovery/triage queries verified-local; prescribed fixes are UNVERIFIED hypotheses (PLAN never executed). |
| Odysseus meta-repo | Re-plan #299 R1 hardening after reviewer NOGO | R1 re-plan (2026-06-19) drew a NOGO from the plan reviewer; the durable finding is wrong-root-cause hardening. Keystone #568 (`ProjectKeystone`, branch `501-impl`): the report blamed an empty-envvar container name + a `_required.yml` env fix, but reading the branch DISPROVED both (`docker-compose.yml:45` static `container_name: projectkeystone-dev`; `action.yml:106-110` already exports `GIT_COMMIT`/`BUILD_UID`/`BUILD_GID` before `podman-compose up` at `:138`). Live failing run `27831294048 --log-failed` (2026-06-19) showed the real cause: `action.yml:97` `apt-get install podman=${PODMAN_APT_VERSION}` → exit 100→127, `podman-version.env:1` pins `5.0.2+ds1-4ubuntu1` no longer in `ubuntu-24.04` (image 20260615); all 5 failing checks share that setup step. Reviewer also forced: scope reduction locked by a per-PR loop (16 PRs confirmed MERGED via `gh pr view --json state`); Scylla review gate confirmed against the LIVE ruleset (`required_approving_review_count = 1`, `homeric-main-baseline`) instead of inferring from commit `d34e291`. Verified-local: live CI log read + branch file reads at ref + ruleset API. UNVERIFIED: the replacement podman version (deferred to `apt-cache madison podman`) and Dependabot rebase mechanics. |
