# Planning: Check If Already Shipped Before Writing a Plan

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-15 |
| **Objective** | Detect whether a GitHub issue's fix is already done before writing an implementation plan — and, even when it IS done, still emit a FORWARD-LOOKING plan (not a retrospective status note) and run every gate yourself instead of deferring to the plan reviewer |
| **Outcome** | Successful — caught both a shipped fix (PR #1308, merged) and a fix that had already landed uncommitted in an untracked `1-fix` worktree (issue #1357); then diagnosed why a "status note" plan for that landed work was NOGO'd (Grade D), and why a SUBSEQUENT plan that withheld its content while a background `pytest` ran was NOGO'd even harder (Grade F, empty placeholder), and what resolves each |
| **Verification** | verified-local (the uncommitted-worktree finding ran a SUBSET of tests; the boundary/mypy/ruff gates ran GREEN this session; the original merged-fix example remains verified-ci) |
| **History** | [changelog](./planning-check-already-shipped-before-planning.history) |

## When to Use

- Planning a follow-up or consolidation issue (issue body may lag behind actual implementation)
- Issue body cites specific file paths, line numbers, **or LOC/method counts** (e.g. "3,570 lines, ~60 methods, god-class needing decomposition") — these go stale after merges OR after the work lands uncommitted
- Picking up an issue from a batch/backlog queue — the fix may have been merged hours or days ago
- **`git status` shows an untracked sibling worktree directory** (e.g. `1-fix/`) — the implementation may already be done there but not yet committed/merged, so `git log` on `main` shows nothing
- The issue describes a refactor/decomposition as FUTURE work but a parallel branch/worktree may have already completed it
- **The plan-loop reviewer NOGO'd your plan as a "status note" / retrospective** — discovering the work is already on disk does NOT exempt you from writing a forward-looking implementation plan; describing what shipped (bullets + caveats) fails the rubric even when the code is correct
- **You're tempted to wait on a background job / Monitor / long test run before producing a due plan or review artifact** — a deliverable with a hard turn-boundary (a plan-loop artifact, a review verdict, any "your output IS the posted artifact" contract) must be emitted NOW from evidence in hand; blocking the emission on a pending background task produces an empty/placeholder artifact that is an automatic Grade F
- Before any implementation plan step — running this check costs seconds and avoids wasted (and worse, duplicate/conflicting) work

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 0. FIRST: is the work already done in an UNCOMMITTED sibling worktree?
#    git log only sees committed history — an untracked worktree is invisible to it.
git status --porcelain            # an untracked dir like "?? 1-fix/" is a red flag
git worktree list                 # enumerate every checkout that may hold the work

# 1. MEASURE the file the issue describes — do NOT trust the issue's stated counts.
#    Issue claims "3,570 lines / ~60 methods, needs decomposition"? Count it yourself:
wc -l path/to/real/file.py                              # actual LOC vs claimed LOC
grep -cE "^\s+def " path/to/real/file.py               # actual method count

# 2. Grep for the function/symbol cited in the issue — find the real file
grep -r "function_name_from_issue" hephaestus/ --include="*.py" -l

# 3. Check if the fix is already in place (new module files, delegation stubs, wiring)
grep -n "the_new_behavior_or_regex" path/to/real/file.py
ls path/to/expected/new_collaborator_modules.py        # do the "to-be-created" files exist?

# 4. Check recent commits for matching descriptions (catches MERGED work only)
git log --oneline -10
git show --stat <sha>

# 5. Run the relevant tests — a passing suite means it's already implemented.
#    NOTE: a SUBSET run will fail the coverage gate (e.g. 9% < threshold) — that is a
#    gate artifact of the subset, NOT a code failure. Run the FULL suite + mypy + ruff
#    before claiming "done"; a green subset is only verified-local.
pixi run pytest tests/unit/path/to/relevant_tests.py -v
```

### Detailed Steps

0. **Check for an uncommitted sibling worktree FIRST** — `git log` only sees committed history. If the work landed in an untracked worktree (`git status` shows `?? 1-fix/`) or any checkout in `git worktree list`, the merged-commit checks below will all come up empty even though the work is fully done on disk. Always run `git status --porcelain` and `git worktree list` before trusting "git log shows nothing → not done yet."

1. **Measure the file, don't trust the issue's stated counts** — The issue body's starting condition (LOC, method count, "needs to be done") is a NARRATIVE that may describe an older state. The issue may have been filed before the work landed. Ground every plan claim in a real measurement: `wc -l file.py`, `grep -cE "^\s+def " file.py`. If the issue says "3,570 lines needing decomposition" but `wc -l` reports 2,449 (already at the target) with the four collaborator modules already on disk, the work is DONE — planning blind would re-do it and risk a duplicate/conflicting implementation.

2. **Find the real file** — Issue bodies frequently cite stale file paths or wrong line numbers. Never trust them directly. Grep the codebase for the function name, class name, or constant names mentioned in the issue. Cite `file.py:line` evidence for every plan claim.

3. **Check for the fix already present** — Once you have the real file path, grep for the new behavior (new constant, new code path, new branch). For a decomposition: `ls` the collaborator modules the issue says should be CREATED, grep for the delegation stubs, and confirm the wiring. If they already exist, the fix is in.

4. **Confirm preservation notes against the live facade** — When a consolidation issue names specific methods/PRs to preserve verbatim (e.g. `_resolve_dirty_pr` #1347, `_resolve_blocked_pr`/`_address_threads_once` #1356, the `resolve_dirty` recursion guard #1355), `grep` to confirm each named method STILL exists on the facade before claiming preservation. This is a critical planning input — a missing method means a regression slipped in.

5. **Confirm via git log (catches MERGED work only)** — Run `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Look for a message matching the issue description. Run `git show --stat <sha>` to confirm the modified files match. Remember this finds only committed work; combine with step 0.

6. **Run tests — and know what a SUBSET proves** — Run `pixi run pytest <relevant test module> -v`. A green subset shows the implementation works, but the coverage gate WILL fail on a subset (e.g. 9% < 83%) purely because most modules went unexercised — that is a gate artifact, not a code failure. Do not claim "done"/`verified-ci` from a subset. The full suite + `mypy` + `ruff` + import-surface/automation-boundary tests are the real proof; if you did not run them this session, the claim is `verified-local`.

7. **Verify DIP/constructor claims against actual signatures, not call sites** — Asserting "no collaborator receives `self`" from reading only the `__init__` wiring is an inference, not proof: a collaborator's own constructor could secretly accept a back-reference. Open each collaborator's `__init__` signature, or let `mypy` be the proof — and label the claim "inferred from call site" until you do.

8. **Document for auditability** — Even when already done, record the evidence: for merged work the commit SHA + PR number + `file:line` range + covering tests; for uncommitted-worktree work the worktree path, the `wc -l`/method counts observed, and which tests passed. Note that line numbers cited from an uncommitted tree may SHIFT if that work is rebased/squashed before merge.

9. **Still emit a FORWARD-LOOKING plan even when the work is already on disk** — The plan-loop reviewer grades the PLAN ARTIFACT, not the on-disk reality. "The fact that the underlying work appears correct on disk does not rehabilitate the plan artifact itself." Writing 5 bullets that DESCRIBE what shipped (plus caveats) is a **category error** — it is a retrospective status note, not a plan, and gets NOGO'd (Grade D) on Completeness, Concreteness, Verification-Plan, and Stage-Handoff. Reshape it as a real plan even when describing already-landed code: frame each module as a "files to create/modify" step with the actual code, give a numbered build order, and give a per-acceptance-criterion verification command. The plan reads as forward-looking; the only honest footnote is "implemented identically to this on disk."

10. **RUN the gates yourself — never DEFER a verification you could run to the reviewer** — Listing a checkable gate (e.g. ADR-0001 boundary tests, `mypy`) as "highest-value follow-up for the plan reviewer" is a **stage-handoff failure** that triggers NOGO. If you can run it during planning, run it and cite it as completed. For the #1357 decomposition this session ran and observed GREEN: the import-surface + automation-boundary tests (ADR-0001 intact), whole-tree `mypy` (the real proof of DIP — no collaborator secretly takes `self`/`CIDriver`, upgrading step 7's call-site inference to proof), `ruff`, and an import-graph confirmation that all 4 collaborators import only sibling `hephaestus.automation.*` + `hephaestus.agents.runtime`, never the base `hephaestus` surface (dependency arrow points automation→library, never reversed). **Gotchas:** (a) the `pixi run mypy` task already targets the whole tree — passing file paths causes `error: Duplicate module named ...`; run `pixi run mypy` with NO arguments. (b) `pixi run pytest` injects `--cov`; ad-hoc subset runs need `--no-cov` (or `-p no:cov`) or pytest errors `unrecognized arguments: --cov`. (c) a subset run reporting low TOTAL coverage (e.g. 9.18%) is a SUBSET ARTIFACT — never cite it as the suite being red OR green.

11. **NEVER gate the emission of a due artifact on an in-flight background job** — Emit the COMPLETE forward-looking plan (or review verdict) from the evidence already in hand: line counts, grep'd stubs, already-green gates. If one verification is still running (a background `pytest`, a `Monitor` you launched, an external job), mark THAT one criterion as "not yet confirmed — open risk, run before completion" INSIDE the Verification section, and emit the rest of the artifact anyway. A plan that is 95% confirmed + 1 flagged open risk is gradeable; a placeholder is an automatic Grade F. Distinguish two situations: (a) a **transient external dependency still in progress when you have NO deadline** — fine to keep working/waiting; (b) **an artifact is due THIS turn** ("your output IS the posted artifact") — you MUST emit now from evidence in hand, never output nothing. Pausing the turn to wait for a background full-suite count, then submitting the literal placeholder "Output not yet flushed. I'll wait for the monitor notification rather than polling.", fails EVERY rubric dimension (Requirements / Completeness / Concreteness / Risk / Verification / Stage-Handoff all F) and is STRICTLY WORSE than the status-note NOGO of step 9 — it addresses none of the prior findings either.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Trust issue body file paths | Used `python_version.py:290-293` as the implementation target (as cited in the issue) | Actual code lived in `scripts_lib/check_python_version_consistency.py` — a completely different file | Issue bodies cite stale paths; always grep to locate the real code |
| Skip pre-plan grep | Started outlining implementation steps before checking whether the code was already there | Would have produced a plan to re-implement something already merged in PR #1308 | A 10-second grep check prevents hours of wasted planning |
| Assume consolidation issue = unshipped | Treated the issue as describing future work because its body said "not yet done" | The issue was a consolidation tracker that lagged behind the actual PR by hours | Consolidation/follow-up issues are high-risk for describing already-shipped work |
| Rely on `git log` alone for "is it done?" | Checked recent commits on `main`; saw nothing matching the decomposition | The work had landed in an UNCOMMITTED untracked `1-fix` worktree — invisible to `git log` because it was never committed | `git log` sees only committed history; always run `git status --porcelain` + `git worktree list` first to catch on-disk-but-uncommitted work |
| Trust the issue's stated LOC/method counts | Planned a decomposition against the issue's "3,570 lines, ~60 methods" starting condition | The file was already 2,449 lines (at the target), all four collaborator modules already existed, tests already green | Measure with `wc -l` / `grep -cE "^\\s+def "` before trusting the issue's narrative; planning blind would re-do landed work and risk a conflicting duplicate |
| Infer DIP from `__init__` call site | Asserted "no collaborator receives self" by reading only the `__init__` wiring | Never opened each collaborator's own constructor to confirm none accept a back-reference — the claim was inferred, not proven | Verify constructor signatures directly (or let `mypy` prove it); label call-site inferences as "inferred" until confirmed |
| Treat a green test SUBSET as "done" | Ran 211 tests across the facade + 4 helper files; all passed | The coverage gate FAILED (9.18%) purely because the subset left most modules unexercised; full suite, mypy, ruff, import-surface tests were NOT run | A green subset is `verified-local`, not `verified-ci`; a failing coverage gate on a subset is a gate artifact, not a code failure — run the full gate before claiming done |
| Submit a "status note" as the plan | Wrote 5 descriptive bullets + caveats summarizing what already shipped, instead of a forward-looking plan | NOGO, Grade D — a category error: it described reality rather than planning work; failed Completeness/Concreteness/Verification-Plan/Stage-Handoff. "On disk being correct does not rehabilitate the plan artifact" | Even when the work is done, emit a REAL plan: design + files-to-modify-with-code + numbered build order + per-criterion verification commands |
| Defer a checkable gate to the reviewer | Listed `test_import_surface.py` / `test_automation_boundary.py` / `mypy` as "highest-value follow-up for the plan reviewer" | Stage-handoff failure → NOGO; a verification you can run yourself must not be punted downstream | RUN every gate you can during planning and cite it as completed; only genuinely-unrunnable checks may be handed off |
| Run `pixi run mypy <paths>` | Passed explicit file paths to the mypy task to type-check only the touched files | `error: Duplicate module named ...` — the `pixi run mypy` task already targets the whole tree, so extra paths double-register modules | Run `pixi run mypy` bare (no arguments); it already covers the whole source tree |
| Run subset `pixi run pytest <files>` without `--no-cov` | Invoked an ad-hoc subset pytest run to check a few modules | `pytest: error: unrecognized arguments: --cov` — the pixi pytest task injects `--cov`, which the bare pytest invocation rejects | Add `--no-cov` (or `-p no:cov`) for ad-hoc subset runs; and treat any low TOTAL-coverage number from a subset as an artifact, not a result |
| Pause the turn on a background job, submit an empty artifact | Started a long-running background `pytest tests/unit/automation` / `Monitor` to get a full-suite pass count, then PAUSED and deferred the turn — so the submitted plan artifact was the literal placeholder "Output not yet flushed. I'll wait for the monitor notification rather than polling." | NOGO, Grade F — an empty/placeholder artifact fails EVERY rubric dimension (Requirements / Completeness / Concreteness / Risk / Verification / Stage-Handoff all F); STRICTLY WORSE than the status-note NOGO and addresses none of the prior findings | Never gate a due artifact on an in-flight background job. Emit the complete plan from evidence in hand; a still-running gate becomes a flagged open-risk line in Verification, never a reason to output nothing. "No deadline → may wait" vs "artifact due this turn → emit from evidence + flag open risk" |

## Results & Parameters

### Concrete example (ProjectHephaestus issue #1291 / PR #1308)

Issue body said: "add YAML sequence format support to `extract_ci_matrix_python_versions`" and cited `python_version.py:290-293` as the bug location.

Grep revealed the real file:
```
hephaestus/scripts_lib/check_python_version_consistency.py
```

Fix confirmed present at lines 17–21 (regex constants) and 173–183 (two-phase dispatch):
```python
_CI_MATRIX_BRACKET_RE = re.compile(r"\[([^\]]+)\]")
_CI_MATRIX_SEQUENCE_RE = re.compile(r"^\s*-\s+(.+)$", re.MULTILINE)
```

Commit: `dd15c35f` — merged via PR #1308 on 2026-06-13 with CI green.
All 11 tests in `tests/unit/scripts_lib/test_check_python_version_consistency.py::TestExtractCiMatrixPythonVersions` pass.

### Concrete example (ProjectHephaestus issue #1357 — already done in an UNCOMMITTED worktree)

Issue body described a FUTURE refactor: "Decompose CIDriver god-class (3,570 lines, ~60 methods)
into 4 SRP collaborators." `git log` on `main` showed nothing matching.

But `git status` showed an untracked sibling worktree:

```text
?? 1-fix/
```

Measuring the file inside that worktree instead of trusting the issue:

```bash
wc -l hephaestus/automation/ci_driver.py     # → 2,449  (already ≤ the 2,450 target)
ls hephaestus/automation/pr_discovery.py \
   hephaestus/automation/ci_check_inspector.py \
   hephaestus/automation/ci_fix_orchestrator.py \
   hephaestus/automation/post_merge_processor.py   # → all four already exist
```

Reality: the work was COMPLETE — facade with one-line delegation stubs, lambda-wrapped DIP
providers wired in `__init__`, and 211 tests green across `test_ci_driver.py` + 4 collaborator
helper files. Planning against the issue's narrative would have produced a plan to RE-DO landed
work, creating a conflicting duplicate implementation. The decomposition execution patterns
themselves live in the `python-module-decomposition-and-refactor-patterns` skill; THIS skill's
lesson is the discipline of catching that it was already done before planning.

Caveats recorded honestly for this finding (why it is `verified-local`, not `verified-ci`):

- Only a SUBSET of tests ran (211 passed); the coverage gate failed at 9.18% as a subset artifact.
- `mypy`, `ruff`, and the import-surface/automation-boundary tests were NOT run this session.
- "No collaborator receives `self`" was inferred from the `__init__` call site, not from reading
  each collaborator's own constructor — `mypy` is the real proof, deferred.
- The "3,570 → 2,449" reduction is reconstructed from the issue's stated original + observed
  current; the actual diff was not inspected.
- Cited line numbers come from the uncommitted tree and may shift if `1-fix` is rebased/squashed.

### Concrete example (issue #1357 — the NOGO and what resolved it)

After confirming the #1357 work was on disk, the first plan submitted was a retrospective
status note: ~5 bullets describing the landed facade + collaborators, plus the caveats above.
The plan-loop reviewer returned **NOGO, Grade D** — a category error: a status note is not a
plan. It failed Completeness, Concreteness, Verification-Plan, and Stage-Handoff. The reviewer
was explicit: "the fact that the underlying work appears correct on disk does not rehabilitate
the plan artifact itself." The specific stage-handoff trigger was deferring the ADR-0001 boundary
check (`test_import_surface.py` / `test_automation_boundary.py` / `mypy`) to the reviewer as
"highest-value follow-up" instead of running it during planning.

Two-part fix that resolves the NOGO: (1) RUN the deferred gates and cite them as completed;
(2) RESHAPE the artifact into a forward-looking plan (each module as a "files to create/modify"
step with its actual code, a numbered build order, a per-criterion verification command).

Gate outputs observed GREEN this session (these RESOLVE the "not run" caveats above for
mypy/ruff/boundary; the full `tests/unit/automation` suite still had no reported pass/fail count
at write time, so the strongest defensible claim remains "affected ci_driver + 4 collaborator
helper tests pass (211) AND the boundary/mypy/ruff gates are green," not "entire automation
suite is green"):

```text
pixi run pytest tests/unit/validation/test_import_surface.py \
                tests/unit/validation/test_automation_boundary.py --no-cov
  → 2 passed                       # ADR-0001 automation→library boundary intact

pixi run mypy                      # NO arguments — task already targets the whole tree
  → Success: no issues found in 402 source files   # proves type-level DIP

pixi run ruff check hephaestus/automation/
  → All checks passed.

wc -l hephaestus/automation/ci_driver.py
  → 2449                           # ≤ 2450 target; 25 delegation stubs
  # preservation methods present at ci_driver.py:781 / :880 / :943 / :1019
```

What mypy-green does and does NOT prove: it proves the import-graph boundary holds and DIP at the
type level (no collaborator secretly takes `self`/`CIDriver`), upgrading step 7's call-site
inference to proof. It does NOT prove each collaborator is behaviorally SRP (single reason to
change) — that remains asserted from the responsibility table, not demonstrated.

### Concrete example (issue #1357 — the SECOND NOGO: an empty placeholder artifact, Grade F)

After the status-note plan was reshaped (step 9) and the deferred gates were run (step 10), the
plan-loop reviewer returned a SECOND NOGO — this time **Grade F**, because the submitted plan
artifact was an EMPTY PLACEHOLDER: the literal text

```text
Output not yet flushed. I'll wait for the monitor notification rather than polling.
```

Root cause: the planner had launched a long-running background verification (a `Monitor` /
background `pytest tests/unit/automation` run to get a full-suite pass count) and PAUSED, deferring
its turn — so when the plan was DUE the artifact contained zero plan content. The reviewer noted
this is STRICTLY WORSE than the prior status-note NOGO: an empty/placeholder artifact fails every
rubric dimension (Requirements / Completeness / Concreteness / Risk / Verification / Stage-Handoff
all F) and addresses none of the prior findings.

The fix (verified — the very next iteration produced a complete plan): never gate the plan artifact
on an in-flight background job. Emit the COMPLETE forward-looking plan from the evidence already in
hand (line counts, grep'd stubs, already-green gates); if one verification is still running, mark
THAT criterion as "not yet confirmed — open risk, run before completion" inside the Verification
section rather than withholding the whole artifact. A plan that is 95% confirmed + 1 flagged open
risk is gradeable; a placeholder is an automatic F.

Generalizable rule: when a deliverable has a hard turn-boundary (a plan-loop artifact, a review
verdict, any "your output IS the posted artifact" contract), treat already-collected evidence as
sufficient to emit a complete draft. A background task that has not reported by the deadline becomes
a documented open-risk line item, never a reason to emit nothing. Distinguish "transient external
dependency still in progress" (legit to keep working/waiting when you have NO deadline) from "an
artifact is due THIS turn" (must emit now from evidence in hand).

### Decision tree for planners

```
Before writing any implementation plan:
│
├─ 0. git status --porcelain + git worktree list
│   └─ untracked sibling worktree (?? 1-fix/) → INSPECT IT; the work may be done-but-uncommitted
│
├─ 1. wc -l / grep -c the file the issue describes
│   └─ counts already at/past the issue's target → work likely already done (verify, don't re-plan)
│
├─ 2. Grep for the function/symbol name → find the real file path
│
├─ 3. Grep for the new behavior / ls the "to-be-created" modules
│   ├─ FOUND on disk → check BOTH git log (merged?) AND the worktree (uncommitted?)
│   │   └─ implementation present + tests pass → it's ALREADY DONE
│   │       └─ STILL write a FORWARD-LOOKING plan (NOT a status note):
│   │           design + files-to-modify-with-code + numbered build order
│   │           + per-criterion verification command, and RUN every gate
│   │           yourself (boundary/mypy/ruff) rather than deferring to the
│   │           reviewer — a status note or a deferred gate = NOGO (Grade D)
│   └─ NOT FOUND → proceed with implementation planning
│
└─ 4. Run tests + gates for the relevant module
    ├─ SUBSET green → verified-local only (coverage gate fails on subsets — a gate artifact;
    │                 run subsets with --no-cov; run `pixi run mypy` bare, no paths)
    ├─ FULL suite + mypy + ruff + boundary green → verified-ci, safe to report done
    └─ SOME FAIL → issue is genuinely open; proceed with planning

When the artifact is DUE this turn (plan-loop / review verdict):
│
└─ Is a background job (pytest / Monitor / external) still running?
    ├─ NO deadline this turn → fine to keep working/waiting
    └─ ARTIFACT DUE THIS TURN → EMIT NOW from evidence in hand; mark the still-running
        gate as an open-risk line in Verification. NEVER withhold the artifact / submit a
        placeholder ("Output not yet flushed…") — that is an automatic Grade F, worse than
        a status note.
