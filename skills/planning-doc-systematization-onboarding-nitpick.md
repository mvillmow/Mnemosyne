(2) you are systematizing a directory whose name COLLIDES with a standard built-in concept (e.g. `docs/release-notes/` vs GitHub's commit-generated release notes; CLAUDE.md may even mandate `gh release create --generate-notes` and 'No CHANGELOG.md') — the convention README's FIRST job is to draw the boundary: state explicitly it is NOT the same-named standard concept, or future contributors conflate the two.

# Planning a Doc-Systematization + Onboarding-Path Audit Nitpick

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-24 |
| **Objective** | Plan a documentation-only audit nitpick that (a) systematizes an "ad-hoc" orphan directory with a convention README and (b) adds an onboarding "first day" path to CONTRIBUTING.md — without deleting a maintained artifact, without conflating a same-named standard concept, without duplicating canonical commands, and without trusting unverified markdown anchor slugs |
| **Outcome** | A planning meta-pattern: run `git log -- <path>` before classifying any artifact as cruft; make the convention README's first job to disambiguate a name that collides with a built-in concept; build the onboarding path as an INDEX of links over existing sections (never re-state commands); and verify every anchor target with a SLUG-AWARE validator that models GitHub's real GFM algorithm (`hephaestus-validate-anchors`), never by grepping heading text |
| **Headline (v1.1.0)** | The v1.0.0 top RISK — "anchor-slug verification" — is now RESOLVED: stop hand-rolling a heading-text grep; search the repo and run the slug-aware validator it already ships (`hephaestus/markdown/anchors.py` → `hephaestus-validate-anchors`, `pyproject.toml:130`; `heading_to_anchor()` reproduces GitHub's exact GFM slug; `validate_anchors()` exits 1 on any `[text](#fragment)` mismatch). Generalized: a verification command is only valid if it would actually FAIL when the thing it proves is broken — construct the failure case (a duplicate-heading slug collision) and confirm a non-zero exit |
| **Headline (v1.2.0)** | VERIFIED-LOCAL: the full workflow was executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus #1544. `pixi run hephaestus-validate-anchors CONTRIBUTING.md --target CONTRIBUTING.md --verbose` → "All anchor links to CONTRIBUTING.md are valid". `pre-commit run --files docs/release-notes/README.md CONTRIBUTING.md` → all passed. Files created/modified: `docs/release-notes/README.md` (new) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` `## Your first day` section (amended). Verification level promoted from `unverified` to `verified-local`. |
| **Verification** | verified-local — the workflow was executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus #1544: `hephaestus-validate-anchors` confirmed all 5 anchor fragments resolve; `pre-commit run --files` passed MD025/MD003/markdownlint; `docs/release-notes/README.md` created and `CONTRIBUTING.md` `## Your first day` section added. Unit test suite run in background at session end. |

## When to Use

- An audit/lint/review NITPICK calls a file in a directory **"ad-hoc"**, **"one-off"**, or **"cruft"** and proposes deleting or ignoring it. Before you classify it, run `git log -- <path>`.
- The issue asks you to **systematize a directory** (add a README documenting its convention) whose **name overlaps a standard built-in concept** — e.g. `docs/release-notes/` vs GitHub's commit-generated release notes, `changelog/` vs a CHANGELOG, `migrations/` vs an ORM's.
- The issue asks for an **onboarding / "first day" / "productive in a day"** section in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the canonical setup/test/PR steps already exist elsewhere in the file.
- A plan **asserts that markdown anchor links resolve** (`#development-setup`, `#testing`, `#pull-request-process`) and you need to verify them at plan time — reach for a slug-aware validator (`hephaestus-validate-anchors`), never a heading-text grep.
- The issue is **documentation-only** — it asks to DOCUMENT, not to change behavior (KISS/YAGNI: do not add validation, do not rename, do not delete).

**Trigger phrases**: "systematize this directory", "this file is ad-hoc / a one-off", "add a README for the convention", "first day / onboarding path", "productive in a day", "link to existing sections", "add anchor links", "release-notes directory", "documentation nitpick bundle".

**Boundary**: IN — planning and executing a doc-only nitpick that adds a convention README and/or an onboarding index, deciding link-vs-duplicate, and verifying anchor slugs. OUT — deleting/renaming the artifact, duplicating canonical commands, changing behavior.

## Verified Workflow

> **v1.2.0 NOTE:** This workflow was executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus #1544 (2026-06-24). All steps confirmed locally: `hephaestus-validate-anchors` → "All anchor links valid"; `pre-commit run --files` → all passed. Verification level: `verified-local`.

### Quick Reference

```text
# Doc-systematization + onboarding nitpick planning checklist (top to bottom)

1. CLASSIFY document-only.
   - Issue asks to DOCUMENT, not change behavior → no delete, no rename,
     no new validation (KISS/YAGNI).

2. GIT-HISTORY before calling an artifact cruft.
     git log -- docs/release-notes/        # or the specific orphan path
   - Added in one PR + maintained in a later PR = LEGITIMATE operational
     note. Write a README that systematizes the convention; do NOT delete.
   - Only an artifact with NO maintenance history is a candidate for removal.

3. DISAMBIGUATE same-named concepts in the README's FIRST line.
   - `docs/release-notes/` collides with GitHub's commit-generated release
     notes. If CLAUDE.md mandates `gh release create --generate-notes` and
     "No CHANGELOG.md", the README MUST state it is NOT those.
   - First job of a convention doc whose name overlaps a built-in: draw the
     boundary, or contributors conflate the two.

4. ONBOARDING path = INDEX of LINKS, never duplicated commands.
   - CONTRIBUTING.md already has Development Setup / Testing / PR Process.
     The gap is SEQUENCING, not content.
   - Link to existing anchors; do NOT re-state `just bootstrap` etc.
     (DRY / single-source-of-truth — duplication drifts).

5. VERIFY anchor SLUGS with a SLUG-AWARE VALIDATOR (RESOLVED in v1.1.0).
   - Markdown anchors are a SILENT-FAILURE class: a wrong slug renders fine
     and lints green. Grepping HEADING TEXT does NOT catch a slug mismatch —
     it passes even on a real collision (`#code-contributions-1`).
   - SEARCH the repo for an existing slug-aware validator before hand-rolling.
     ProjectHephaestus ships one:
       pixi run hephaestus-validate-anchors CONTRIBUTING.md \
         --target CONTRIBUTING.md --verbose
     (hephaestus/markdown/anchors.py; pyproject.toml:130). `heading_to_anchor()`
     reproduces GitHub's exact GFM slug; `validate_anchors()` exits 1 on a
     mismatch. Add a unit guard for the slug algorithm itself:
       pytest tests/unit/markdown/test_anchors.py

6. META-CHECK every verification command: would it FAIL when broken?
   - A verification command is only valid if it would actually exit non-zero
     when the thing it claims to prove is broken. "Greps heading text"
     silently substitutes a WEAKER predicate for the real one.
   - Construct the failure case (duplicate-heading slug collision) and confirm
     the command catches it. Prefer a tool that models the real artifact
     (GFM slug) over a hand-rolled approximation.

7. READ the actual `.markdownlint.yaml` before tailoring prose.
   - It is the single source of truth for which rules fire. Reading it showed
     `MD013: false` (line-length DISABLED — a moot worry) while MD025 (one H1)
     and MD003 (ATX) are what actually fire. Do not tailor prose to imagined
     rules; check the config.

8. STATE verification honestly.
   - If plan authored but not yet run → "unverified"; keep warning banner.
   - If commands run locally and passed → "verified-local"; update frontmatter
     and remove warning banners. (v1.2.0: `hephaestus-validate-anchors` +
     `pre-commit run --files` both passed; level promoted to verified-local.)
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Classify document-only.** Read the issue. If it says "document", "systematize", "add a README", "add an onboarding section", the scope is documentation. Do NOT delete the orphan, do NOT rename anything, do NOT add validation (KISS/YAGNI). The source issue (ProjectHephaestus #1544) was an S2 low-priority nitpick bundle that asked only to document.

2. **Run `git log -- <path>` before calling any artifact cruft.** The audit labelled `docs/release-notes/plan-reviewer-final-verdict.md` an ad-hoc one-off. `git log -- docs/release-notes/` showed it was added in PR #571 and deliberately maintained in #1268 — a legitimate operational note, not garbage. A maintained file warrants a README that **systematizes the convention** ("component-scoped operational notes"), never deletion. Only an artifact with no maintenance history is a removal candidate.

3. **Disambiguate a same-named standard concept in the README's first line.** `release-notes` collides with GitHub's auto-generated release notes. This repo's CLAUDE.md mandates "No CHANGELOG.md; release notes generated from commits via `gh release create --generate-notes`". The convention README's first job is to state explicitly it is **NOT** that — these are component-scoped operational notes, distinct from commit-generated GitHub release notes. Otherwise future contributors conflate the two. When systematizing any directory whose name overlaps a built-in concept, draw the boundary up front.

4. **Build the onboarding path as an INDEX of links, never duplicated commands.** CONTRIBUTING.md already had every step (Development Setup, Testing, PR Process); the only gap was sequencing. The "first day" section must LINK existing canonical sections via anchors, NOT re-state `just bootstrap` or any command (DRY / single-source-of-truth — a duplicated command drifts the moment the canonical section changes). A "productive in a day" path is an index over existing sections, not new prose.

5. **Verify anchor SLUGS with a slug-aware validator — RESOLVED in v1.1.0.** Markdown anchor links are a silent-failure class: a wrong slug renders fine and the linter stays green. The first plan claimed `#development-setup`, `#code-contributions`, `#testing`, `#pull-request-process`, `#platform-support` all resolve, and "verified" them by grepping the heading TEXT (`grep -nE '^#{1,3} ' CONTRIBUTING.md`). The reviewer's NOGO named it precisely: that grep "would pass on a real slug collision; the top stated risk is unverified by the very check meant to catch it." The FIX: **search the repo for an existing slug-aware validator before hand-rolling a check.** ProjectHephaestus already ships one — `hephaestus/markdown/anchors.py`, exposed as the console script `hephaestus-validate-anchors` (registered at `pyproject.toml:130`). Its `heading_to_anchor()` reproduces GitHub's exact slug algorithm (lowercase → spaces→hyphens → strip non-`[a-z0-9-]` → collapse consecutive hyphens → strip leading/trailing), and `validate_anchors()` checks every `[text](#fragment)` link against the real heading-slug set and exits 1 on any mismatch. The plan now calls `pixi run hephaestus-validate-anchors CONTRIBUTING.md --target CONTRIBUTING.md --verbose`, plus a unit-level guard `pytest tests/unit/markdown/test_anchors.py` for the slug algorithm the check depends on. This turned a non-functional verification step (heading-text grep) into a functional one. **v1.2.0 CONFIRMED:** these commands were run in the actual implementation for ProjectHephaestus #1544; `hephaestus-validate-anchors` reported "All anchor links to CONTRIBUTING.md are valid".

6. **Meta-check every verification command: would it FAIL when the thing is broken?** Generalizable lesson for planners: a verification command is only valid if it would actually exit non-zero when the thing it claims to prove is broken. "Greps the heading text" silently substitutes a weaker predicate for the real one. When you assert a check proves risk X, mentally construct the failure case (here: a duplicate-heading slug collision producing `#code-contributions-1`) and confirm the command would exit non-zero on it. Prefer an existing repo tool that models the real artifact (the GFM slug) over a hand-rolled approximation.

7. **Read the actual `.markdownlint.yaml` before tailoring prose to imagined rules.** The first plan worried about MD013 (line length) without reading the config. Reading `.markdownlint.yaml` (the repo's single source of truth for which rules fire) showed `MD013: false` — disabled — so the worry was moot, while MD025 (one H1) and MD003 (ATX) are what actually fire. Identify the real binding gate AND enumerate its enabled rules from the config; do not tailor prose to a rule that is turned off, and do not miss a rule that is on. Run the gate; read the output.

8. **Record the honest verification level.** If the plan has been authored but not run, keep `verification: unverified` and a "Proposed Workflow" warning. When the commands have been executed locally and passed, promote to `verified-local` and remove the warning banner. **v1.2.0:** The implementation for ProjectHephaestus #1544 ran `hephaestus-validate-anchors` (confirmed all 5 anchor fragments valid) and `pre-commit run --files` (MD025, MD003, markdownlint all passed), promoting this skill from `unverified` to `verified-local`.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Treat `docs/release-notes/plan-reviewer-final-verdict.md` as ad-hoc cruft to delete | Accepted the audit's "one-off" label at face value | `git log -- docs/release-notes/` shows it was added in PR #571 and maintained in #1268 — a legitimate operational note | Run `git log -- <path>` before classifying any artifact as cruft; a maintained file warrants a README, not deletion |
| Write the release-notes README without disambiguating | Documented the convention but did not separate it from GitHub's commit-generated release notes | Name collides with a built-in concept (CLAUDE.md mandates `gh release create --generate-notes`, "No CHANGELOG.md") → contributors conflate the two | The convention doc's FIRST job is to draw the boundary: state it is NOT the same-named standard concept |
| Restate `just bootstrap` and other commands in the new onboarding section | Re-wrote the setup steps inline for a self-contained "first day" path | Duplicates canonical CONTRIBUTING.md sections → drift the moment they change (violates DRY / single-source-of-truth) | An onboarding path is an INDEX of LINKS over existing sections, not new prose; link the anchors, never restate commands |
| Verify anchor links by grepping the HEADING TEXT | `grep -nE '^#{1,3} ' CONTRIBUTING.md` confirmed each target heading exists | Reviewer NOGO: the grep "would pass on a real slug collision; the top stated risk is unverified by the very check meant to catch it." Heading text ≠ rendered slug (`#code-contributions-1`) | RESOLVED: search the repo for a slug-aware validator first — run `hephaestus-validate-anchors` (`hephaestus/markdown/anchors.py`, `pyproject.toml:130`); `heading_to_anchor()` models GitHub's GFM slug and `validate_anchors()` exits 1 on a `[text](#fragment)` mismatch. Add `pytest tests/unit/markdown/test_anchors.py` as the slug-algorithm guard |
| Assert a verification command "proves" a risk without checking it would FAIL when broken | Stated the heading-text grep as proof the anchor risk was handled | A check that cannot exit non-zero on the failure case proves nothing — it silently substitutes a weaker predicate | META-LESSON: a verification command is valid only if it would FAIL when the thing it proves is broken; construct the failure case (duplicate-heading slug collision) and confirm a non-zero exit; prefer a tool that models the real GFM artifact |
| Infer GFM slugs from memory (`## Development Setup` → `#development-setup`) | Assumed the standard GFM rule without confirming against the repo's markdownlint config | Was NOT confirmed against this repo's specific config; a non-standard slug renders fine and lints green | Do not infer slugs from memory; generate them with the actual slug-aware validator the repo ships (`heading_to_anchor()`) |
| Assume the Code-of-Conduct section is one short paragraph for the insertion offset | Pinned the new section "after line 8" based on a plan-time read | If the file shifted, the line offset is stale | Re-locate the insertion point by a stable content anchor (heading substring), not a hardcoded line number |
| Codify 3 header keys from ONE example file as "the convention" (P7/POLA) | Reverse-engineered `**Affected component:**` / `**Issues:**` / `**Ships with:**` from a single sample and presented them as the required schema | Reviewer flagged it as astonishing (POLA): a convention invented from n=1 is an invented rule, not an observed one | Present single-sample keys as "the existing example uses these keys … a convention by example, not a hard schema"; REQUIRE only the narrative sections, not the keys |
| Worry about MD013 (line length) without reading `.markdownlint.yaml` | Tailored prose to an imagined line-length rule and named `pre-commit run --all-files` as the gate | Reading `.markdownlint.yaml` (the single source of truth) showed `MD013: false` — DISABLED; the worry was moot, while MD025 (one H1) and MD003 (ATX) are what actually fire | Read the actual `.markdownlint.yaml` to know which rules fire BEFORE tailoring prose; do not guard against a disabled rule or miss an enabled one |

### Resolved (v1.1.0)

1. **Anchor-slug mismatch (was the #1 risk) — RESOLVED.** Stop hand-rolling a heading-text grep; run the slug-aware validator the repo already ships: `pixi run hephaestus-validate-anchors <doc> --target <doc> --verbose` (`hephaestus/markdown/anchors.py`, `pyproject.toml:130`). `heading_to_anchor()` models GitHub's exact GFM slug; `validate_anchors()` exits 1 on any `[text](#fragment)` mismatch. Guard the algorithm with `pytest tests/unit/markdown/test_anchors.py`.
2. **Over-generalized README header keys — RESOLVED (framing).** The three keys are now presented as "the existing example uses these keys … a convention by example, not a hard schema"; only the narrative sections are required, not the keys.
3. **Unenumerated lint rules — RESOLVED.** Read `.markdownlint.yaml`: `MD013: false` (line length disabled); MD025 (one H1) and MD003 (ATX) are the rules that actually fire. Tailor prose to the config, not to imagined rules.

### Resolved (v1.2.0)

4. **End-to-end execution — RESOLVED.** The full workflow was executed for ProjectHephaestus #1544 (2026-06-24): `hephaestus-validate-anchors CONTRIBUTING.md --target CONTRIBUTING.md --verbose` → "All anchor links to CONTRIBUTING.md are valid"; `pre-commit run --files docs/release-notes/README.md CONTRIBUTING.md` → all passed (MD025, MD003, markdownlint clean). `docs/release-notes/README.md` created; `## Your first day` section added to `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Verification promoted from `unverified` to `verified-local`.
5. **Stale insertion offset — RESOLVED (practice).** The `## Your first day` section was inserted using a stable content anchor (after the Code-of-Conduct paragraph, before `## Planning artifacts`) via Edit tool with surrounding prose context — not a hardcoded line number.

### Risks (still carried)

1. **PR-merged / CI green.** Verification is `verified-local`. The PR for ProjectHephaestus #1544 must still pass CI and merge before this reaches `verified-ci`. Track via PR state.


## Results & Parameters

Copy-paste pre-implementation checklist for a doc-systematization + onboarding nitpick:

```text
[ ] Document-only?  (issue asks to DOCUMENT/systematize — no delete, no rename, no new validation)
[ ] git log -- <path> run?  (artifact's maintenance history checked BEFORE calling it cruft; maintained → README not deletion)
[ ] Same-named concept disambiguated?  (README's first line states it is NOT the built-in concept, e.g. NOT GitHub commit-generated release notes)
[ ] Onboarding path LINKS, not duplicates?  (anchors to existing sections; NO restated commands like `just bootstrap` — DRY)
[ ] Anchor SLUGS verified with a SLUG-AWARE validator?  (`hephaestus-validate-anchors` — `hephaestus/markdown/anchors.py`, exits 1 on a `[text](#fragment)` mismatch — NOT a heading-text grep; the biggest risk)
[ ] Slug algorithm unit-guarded?  (`pytest tests/unit/markdown/test_anchors.py` — the check depends on `heading_to_anchor()`)
[ ] Every verification command would FAIL when broken?  (construct the failure case — duplicate-heading slug collision — and confirm a non-zero exit; prefer a tool that models the real GFM artifact)
[ ] Insertion point re-anchored on content?  (not a hardcoded line offset like "after line 8")
[ ] README convention keys framed as example, not schema?  (single-sample keys = "convention by example", only narrative sections REQUIRED — POLA)
[ ] `.markdownlint.yaml` actually read?  (which rules FIRE — e.g. MD013 may be `false`/disabled; MD025 one-H1 + MD003 ATX are what fire — before tailoring prose)
[ ] Doc gate actually run?  (executed locally; output read; not assumed)
[ ] Verification level stated honestly?  (unverified if plan authored but not run; verified-local if commands passed locally; update frontmatter accordingly)
```

**Source context**: Extracted from the implementation of ProjectHephaestus issue #1544 — a low-priority S2 documentation-nitpick bundle pairing (a) a `docs/release-notes/README.md` that systematizes a directory holding one deliberately-maintained operational note (`plan-reviewer-final-verdict.md`, added in PR #571, maintained in #1268) as "component-scoped operational notes" distinct from commit-generated GitHub release notes, with (b) a "Your first day" onboarding section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` that LINKS (does not duplicate) the existing Development Setup / Testing / PR Process sections. **v1.1.0 captured the RE-PLAN after a reviewer NOGO** that resolved the anchor-slug verification gap (swap heading-text grep for `hephaestus-validate-anchors`). **v1.2.0 promotes to `verified-local`**: the full workflow was executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus #1544 (2026-06-24) — `hephaestus-validate-anchors CONTRIBUTING.md --target CONTRIBUTING.md --verbose` confirmed all 5 anchor fragments valid; `pre-commit run --files docs/release-notes/README.md CONTRIBUTING.md` passed MD025/MD003/markdownlint; the two files were created/amended and the implementation PR was opened with auto-merge armed. Verified outputs: `docs/release-notes/README.md` (new file — single H1, ATX headings, disambiguation from GitHub release notes, header keys as convention-by-example); `CONTRIBUTING.md` (amended — `## Your first day` section with 5 steps linking `#development-setup`, `#code-contributions`, `#testing`, `#pull-request-process`, `#platform-support`).

**Sibling skills**: `planning-audit-doc-nitpick-stamp-and-document` (docstring gap + version/date stamp nitpicks), `ci-cd-load-bearing-filename-nitpick-document-dont-rename` (discoverability-rename nitpicks), `github-relative-doc-links-resolve-to-file-location` (relative-link resolution), `contributing-md-structure-sync` (CONTRIBUTING.md structure).
