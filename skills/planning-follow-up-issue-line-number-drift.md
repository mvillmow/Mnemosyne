# Planning: Follow-Up Issue Line Number Drift

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-13 |
| **Objective** | Correctly locate the real documentation gap when a follow-up issue's cited line numbers have shifted due to intervening PR merges |
| **Outcome** | Successful — plan correctly identified that the function docstring was already fixed by PR #1303, but the module-level `FAILS LOUDLY` block still omitted the marker-excluded fallback case |
| **Verification** | verified-local |

When a follow-up issue is filed during or after a sibling PR's review process, the cited file
state often lags behind `main`. The function-level fix the issue targets may have already landed,
while a subtler module-level gap remains unfixed. This skill documents how to detect that situation
and find the actual remaining gap.

## When to Use

- Planning any issue whose body cites specific line numbers (follow-up issues, refinement issues, audit findings)
- Issue body references a PR as "pending" but that PR is now merged on `main`
- Issue text says "After PR #N this is false" but you haven't confirmed whether #N has merged
- Docstring fix issues targeting a specific function — the function may be fixed but the module docstring may still be stale
- Any issue filed from within another PR's review thread (high likelihood of pre-merge line number references)

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Check git log for the most recent commit(s) touching the cited file
git log --oneline -10 -- scripts/check_license_compatibility.py

# 2. See exactly what the most recent relevant commit changed
git show <sha> -- scripts/check_license_compatibility.py | grep -A 20 "def scan"

# 3. Grep BOTH the module docstring AND function docstrings separately
#    (the issue may only mention one; the other may still be stale)
grep -n "FAILS LOUDLY\|marker.*exclud\|FALLBACK" scripts/check_license_compatibility.py | head -30

# 4. Verify current line numbers for issue-cited line ranges
#    (the issue may cite e.g. lines 248-251, but those may now be 257-262)
grep -n "def scan" scripts/check_license_compatibility.py

# 5. Check module-level docstring separately (lines 1-30 typically)
head -30 scripts/check_license_compatibility.py
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1: Identify the most recent commit touching the file

Before reading the issue's cited line numbers, run `git log --oneline -10 -- <file>` to
find the SHA of the most recent commit. This tells you which PR last touched the file
and whether the issue's claimed "current state" is actually `main`'s current state.

```bash
git log --oneline -10 -- scripts/check_license_compatibility.py
# → dd15c35 fix(scripts_lib): ...
# → ee35ed87 fix(license-scan): classify marker-excluded deps via FALLBACK_LICENSES
```

The commit `ee35ed87` (PR #1303) is the most recent. If the issue was filed
referencing lines from before that commit, all line numbers in the issue body are stale.

#### Step 2: See what the most recent commit actually fixed

```bash
git show ee35ed87 -- scripts/check_license_compatibility.py | grep -A 20 "def scan"
```

This confirms whether the issue's stated fix target (e.g., the `scan()` function docstring)
is already addressed in `ee35ed87`. If yes, move to step 3 to find the remaining gap.

#### Step 3: Grep module-level and function-level docstrings separately

Issues about docstring staleness almost always cite a function-level docstring. But module-level
docstrings (the `"""..."""` block at the top of the file, or a `FAILS LOUDLY` block) can also
be stale and are rarely covered by the same fix.

```bash
# Check if any keyword from the fix appears in the module-level block (lines 1-30)
grep -n "FAILS LOUDLY\|marker.*exclud\|FALLBACK\|fallback" scripts/check_license_compatibility.py | head -20
```

If the result shows zero matches for lines 1–27 (the module docstring range) but matches in
lines 257+ (the function), the module-level block is the gap the fix missed.

#### Step 4: Verify issue-cited line numbers against current HEAD

Cross-reference the issue's cited lines (e.g., "lines 248–251") against where those lines
actually live now:

```bash
# Find the current line of the construct the issue cited
grep -n "def scan\|are skipped with a note" scripts/check_license_compatibility.py
```

If the issue cited line 248 but the content is now at line 262, you know the file
has grown by ~14 lines due to the intervening PR. The fix content is the same; only the
address has shifted.

#### Step 5: Confirm the real remaining gap

After verifying both module-level and function-level docstrings, document the specific
gap: what text is missing, what lines it should be added at (current HEAD line numbers),
and which PR already fixed the adjacent content (so the reviewer can understand scope).

```bash
# Show lines 10-20 of the module docstring to see the FAILS LOUDLY block
sed -n '10,20p' scripts/check_license_compatibility.py
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Trust issue-cited line numbers verbatim | Used lines 248–251 from the issue body as the edit target | Those lines had shifted to 257–262 after PR #1303 landed; the content was wrong before even reading | Always run `grep -n "def <function>"` to find the actual current line number |
| Assume the function docstring is still stale | Planned to fix the `scan()` docstring as the issue described | PR #1303 had already fixed `scan()`'s docstring; the fix was already on `main` | Run `git show <latest-sha>` to see what the most recent commit actually changed |
| Read only the function-level docstring | Grepped only `def scan` and read 20 lines below it | Missed the module-level `FAILS LOUDLY` block (lines 12–17) which still omitted the marker-excluded case | Grep module-level AND function-level docstrings separately; they are independently maintained |
| Trust "After PR #N this is false" in issue body | Assumed PR #1304 was the relevant merge since issue cited it | The issue was filed from within PR #1304's review process, citing a state PR #1303 had already fixed on `main` | Check whether the referenced PR is actually merged; issues filed mid-PR-process use pre-merge state |
| Skip git log for docstring-only issues | Assumed low-risk docstring fixes don't need git archaeology | The git log revealed the exact SHA that fixed the function docstring, which was necessary to identify the remaining module-level gap | `git log --oneline -10 -- <file>` is a 2-second check that prevents the rest of the plan from being wrong |

## Results & Parameters

### Concrete example (ProjectHephaestus issue #1306)

Issue body said: "`scan()` docstring still has stale text 'are skipped with a note, not treated as a hole'."
Issue cited lines 248–251.

Step 1 revealed: the most recent commit touching the file was `ee35ed87` (PR #1303,
"fix(license-scan): classify marker-excluded deps via FALLBACK_LICENSES").

Step 2 confirmed: PR #1303 already fixed the `scan()` function docstring — the stale
text cited by the issue was removed in that PR.

Step 3 discovered the real gap: the **module-level** `FAILS LOUDLY` block (lines 12–17)
enumerated three behaviors but omitted the fourth: "marker-excluded dependencies get
a FALLBACK_LICENSES entry rather than a HOLE". Zero grep hits for `FALLBACK` in lines 1–27.

Step 4 confirmed line drift: the issue cited lines 248–251, which are now at 257–262
after intervening commits added ~11 lines.

Actual fix target: module docstring lines 12–17, not the function at 257–262.

### Decision tree for follow-up issue planning

```
Received a follow-up / refinement issue with cited line numbers:
│
├─ 1. git log --oneline -10 -- <file>
│   └─ Find the most recent commit touching the file
│
├─ 2. git show <sha> -- <file> | grep -A 20 "<cited function>"
│   ├─ Fix already in latest commit → function docstring gap is CLOSED
│   │   └─ Proceed to step 3 to find remaining gap
│   └─ Fix NOT in latest commit → function docstring still stale
│       └─ Plan the function docstring fix
│
├─ 3. Grep module-level AND function-level docstrings SEPARATELY
│   grep -n "<keyword>" <file> | head -20
│   ├─ Keyword absent in module doc (lines 1-30) but present in function → MODULE GAP found
│   └─ Keyword absent everywhere → broader audit needed
│
└─ 4. Verify issue-cited line numbers vs current grep output
    ├─ Lines match → no drift; issue is up to date
    └─ Lines differ → drift detected; use grep-found line numbers in the plan
```

### Key commands for follow-up issue planning

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Find most recent commit touching a file | `git log --oneline -10 -- <file>` |
| See what a specific commit changed in a file | `git show <sha> -- <file> \| grep -A 20 "def <fn>"` |
| Find current line of a function | `grep -n "def <fn>" <file>` |
| Grep module-level block separately | `grep -n "<keyword>" <file> \| head -20` (then check which lines are in 1–30 range) |
| Show first 30 lines of a file | `head -30 <file>` or `sed -n '1,30p' <file>` |
| Confirm whether a referenced PR merged | `gh pr view <N> --json state,mergedAt --jq '.state, .mergedAt'` |

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1306 — stale docstring in `scripts/check_license_compatibility.py` | Function docstring already fixed by PR #1303; module-level `FAILS LOUDLY` block was the real remaining gap |
