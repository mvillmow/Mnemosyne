# Python Import Patterns and Compatibility Guards

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-08-05 |
| **Objective** | Manage the Python import graph and import compatibility across versions and platforms: avoid circular dependencies with function-local imports, extend public SDK surfaces via lazy exports without eager-load regressions, guard stdlib imports that vary by Python version or OS, keep hardcoded surface-pinning tests from going stale when peers land via parallel PRs, emit an access-time `DeprecationWarning` across the PEP 562 lazy-loader seam, and — when adding a public symbol to a package `__all__` in a repo with a per-symbol `COMPATIBILITY.md` API table guarded by a live-tree-scanning validation test — add the matching alphabetical table row (with a version column resolved from same-cycle siblings) AND run the full validation module, because the live-tree alignment check is a FALSE NEGATIVE when run in isolation |
| **Outcome** | Acyclic import graphs, Windows-importable packages, CI matrices green on older Python and POSIX-only stdlib, lazy SDK surfaces that scale to new peer classes, a decision procedure for fixing stale pinned-`__all__` tests (test vs source) without chasing live-session environment noise, a verified workflow for emitting a deprecation warning at `__getattr__` access time, and a verified workflow for keeping a per-symbol `COMPATIBILITY.md` API table aligned with a widened `__all__` — confirming the `missing-from-docs` failure surfaces only in the FULL validation module (isolated runs are false negatives), that the row goes alphabetically into the right `### <pkg>` section, and that the "since" version is read off same-cycle sibling helpers (not `git describe --tags`) |
| **Verification** | verified-ci (function-local / version-guard / Windows-guard / lazy-exports); verified-local (surface-pin-stale fix, access-time deprecation-warning implementation — section F executed end-to-end with all tests passing locally; section G — __all__ alignment / eager re-export / subset-assertion pin executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus issue #1511, all tests passing locally; section G′ — per-symbol COMPATIBILITY.md API-table row alignment + the full-suite-only live-tree-scan false-negative hazard executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus issue #1419, all affected tests passing locally including `tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py`, ruff/mypy/markdownlint clean; this also UPGRADES the COMPATIBILITY.md per-symbol version-stamping guidance — previously `unverified` from issue #1513 — to `verified-local` (the version column is resolved from same-cycle siblings, confirmed on disk: `configure_cli_logging` = 0.9.8, matching `create_validation_parser`/`resolve_repo_root`, even though the latest tag was `v0.9.7`); CI pending after the ProjectHephaestus PR merges); **unverified** planning-guidance (section H — adding the companion `__dir__()` to a PEP 562 lazy-loader package; derived from a plan for ProjectHephaestus issue #1512, not yet executed in CI) |

**v1.9.0 amendment:** Section I adds unverified planning guidance for retiring obsolete
stdlib backports when a repository's declared Python floor already guarantees the module,
and for routing remaining production imports through an existing canonical resolver. Earlier
verified sections retain their recorded confidence. [History](./python-import-patterns-and-compatibility-guards.history).

**v1.10.0 amendment:** Section J adds unverified planning guidance for eliminating package
cycles through dependency-neutral leaf modules and enforcing the result with a reusable AST
graph plus strongly connected component guard. Earlier verified sections retain their recorded
confidence. [History](./python-import-patterns-and-compatibility-guards.history).

## When to Use

- **Function-local imports (coupling avoidance)**: A child module needs ambient state from a parent module (e.g., `logging.utils` already imports `utils.helpers`), and a module-level child-to-parent import would create a circular dependency or import-graph bloat. The import is used in only one or two functions.
- **Lazy exports (SDK surface)**: Extending a public package `__all__` with peer classes from submodules, adding `TYPE_CHECKING` imports, preventing eager-load regressions, or avoiding architectural restructuring when widening the public surface.
- **Version-gated stdlib guard**: A CI matrix includes Python 3.10 and code does a bare import of a 3.11+ stdlib module (`tomllib`, `ExceptionGroup`); `pytest` collection fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` on the lowest Python in the matrix.
- **Windows / POSIX-only stdlib guard**: Adding a cross-OS CI matrix where Windows jobs fail with `ModuleNotFoundError` for `curses`/`fcntl`/`termios`/`grp`/`pwd`, or `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo` raises `ZoneInfoNotFoundError` on Windows (needs `tzdata`).
- **Lazy-export add/add rebase conflict**: A branch widens the lazy SDK surface (`_LAZY_EXPORTS` + `__all__` + `__getattr__`) and goes `DIRTY`/`CONFLICTING` because a *sibling PR already landed the identical export* on main. The PR reads as "CI failing" but the logs show only runner/setup steps and **no test actually failed** — the merge conflict itself is the blocker. Resolve by keeping ONE copy of the shared entry.
- **Stale surface-pin test (branch-divergence / merge-skew)**: A hardcoded surface-pinning test (`assert set(__all__) == {literal}`) fails on CI with `Extra items in the left set: '<Symbol>'`, where `<Symbol>` is a *legitimate* peer export that landed on `main` via an independent PR while your feature branch was open. The production `__init__.py` is correct; the test literal went stale. You need to decide whether the test or the source is wrong, then fix only the stale party — and to do that you must separate the real CI failure from environment noise that only appears when the local suite runs inside a live automation session.
- **Access-time deprecation warning across the lazy-loader seam (verified-local)**: You need to make a deprecated lazy shim (e.g. `retry_with_jitter`) warn at *attribute-access* time, not only when called, by adding a `warnings.warn(...)` inside the package `__getattr__` / `_LAZY_IMPORTS` resolver. Key verified facts: the issue may misname *where* the symbol lives (`_LAZY_IMPORTS` vs `__all__`) — grep first; the existing call-time warning is a *different* layer covering a different access path (keep both); PEP 562 caches the resolved name into module globals so the access warning fires once per process — the test must `module.__dict__.pop(name, None)` to re-trigger `__getattr__`; `stacklevel=2` IS correct inside `__getattr__` (call stack: user access line → `__getattr__` → `warnings.warn`); an existing regression test that documents the current silent resolve must be *rewritten*, not supplemented; and a prose doc (`COMPATIBILITY.md`) describing the warning as firing "when called" must be updated in the same PR.
- **Promoting undeclared public-looking symbols to the package surface — audit-finding fix (verified-local for __all__ alignment; unverified for COMPATIBILITY.md version-stamping)**: One or more existing, public-looking functions are present in a submodule but absent from the package `__init__.py`'s `__all__`, so `from pkg import sym` fails for external users while internal callers work around it by importing from the submodule directly. Key verified patterns from ProjectHephaestus issue #1511 (`hephaestus/cli/__init__.py` aligned with `hephaestus/cli/utils.py`): **expand scope** from the named symbols to ALL missing symbols when the same defect class applies — fixing all four (`DRY_RUN_HELP_CAVEAT`, `add_dry_run_arg`, `add_github_throttle_args`, `configure_github_throttle_from_args`) prevented re-triggering the same audit finding; choose **eager re-export** (`from hephaestus.cli.utils import (…)` in `__init__.py`) when the source module pulls only stdlib — no `_LAZY_EXPORTS` infrastructure needed; **no COMPATIBILITY.md change** is needed when the package has no per-symbol table (only a tier-level entry at the package level); pin the test with a **subset assertion** (`set(utils.__all__) - set(cli.__all__)`) so parallel PRs adding new symbols cannot break it; always include `test_import_surface.py`/`test_automation_boundary.py` in the verification set. Additional planning traps (from a plan for ProjectHephaestus issue #1513 — still unverified): stamping the COMPATIBILITY.md "Added" version by guessing from the latest git tag; missing a non-local strict-equality surface-pin test; building on an unverified stability-tier premise; getting the re-export binding wrong for `monkeypatch`/`mock.patch` paths. See section G.
- **Adding a public symbol to `__all__` in a repo with a per-symbol `COMPATIBILITY.md` API table + a live-tree-scanning validation test (verified-local)**: You add one name to a package `__all__` (e.g. `configure_cli_logging` to `hephaestus/cli/utils.py:__all__` and re-export it from `hephaestus/cli/__init__.py:__all__`), and a validation test that scans the LIVE repo (`tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py` — `TestLiveTreeAlignment::test_real_compatibility_md_is_aligned` and `TestMain::test_main_returns_zero_on_real_repo`) fails with `[missing-from-docs] hephaestus.cli.configure_cli_logging is in __all__ but has no row in COMPATIBILITY.md`. The fix is to add an ALPHABETICAL row to the matching `### hephaestus.cli` section, with the "since" version resolved from same-cycle sibling helpers (NOT from `git describe --tags`). The DANGEROUS part (section G′): this test scans the on-disk `__all__` + `COMPATIBILITY.md` at scan time, so it can PASS when run in ISOLATION yet FAIL only when you run the WHOLE module / broad `tests/unit/validation` suite — an isolated green run is a FALSE NEGATIVE. After editing ANY `__all__` or `[project.scripts]`/public-export surface, run the full validation module before claiming green. See section G′. (Verified-local for ProjectHephaestus issue #1419; this upgrades the issue #1513 COMPATIBILITY.md version-stamping guidance from `unverified` to `verified-local`.)
- **Adding the companion `__dir__()` to a PEP 562 lazy-loader package — discoverability fix (unverified planning-guidance)**: A package defines a module-level `__getattr__` for lazy loading (PEP 562), but defines no module-level `__dir__()`, so `dir(pkg)` shows only the eagerly-bound names (~4: `__version__`, `__author__`, dunders) and the entire lazy public API (everything in `_LAZY_IMPORTS` / `__all__`) is invisible to IPython tab-completion, IDEs, and doc generators. This is a POLA/discoverability defect, not a correctness bug. The fix adds `def __dir__() -> list[str]: return sorted(set(_LAZY_IMPORTS) | set(__all__) | set(globals()))` and pins it with a surface test. The planning traps: a custom `__dir__` REPLACES the default listing (it does not auto-union module globals), so you MUST fold `set(globals())` in or you silently SHRINK the visible set; `__dir__` returns names only (no attribute access), so listing a deprecated lazy shim does NOT fire its `DeprecationWarning`; pin by a SUBSET INVARIANT (`set(_LAZY_IMPORTS) <= set(dir(pkg))`), never a hardcoded count (the audit's "35 symbols" was already stale at 40 on disk); and regression-test that `dir()` does not SHRINK vs today (`__version__`/`__author__` must remain). See section H. (Derived from a plan for ProjectHephaestus issue #1512; this guidance is `unverified` — the plan has not been executed in CI.)

- **Retiring obsolete compatibility guards / enforcing canonical resolvers (unverified planning-guidance)**: The declared minimum Python already includes a formerly version-gated stdlib module, but production code still carries a backport branch; or a shared resolver exists and a few consumers import the module directly. Read the support floor and CI matrix first, delete only guards made unreachable by that contract, keep platform data packages such as `tzdata` when runtime data still needs them, and route all consumers through the canonical resolver so import policy has one owner. See section I.
- **Enforcing a whole-package acyclic import graph (unverified planning-guidance)**: A cycle spans entrypoints, adapters, package initializers, function-local imports, or PEP 562 lazy-export maps, so a prefix scan or cold-import test can miss it. Extract low-level execution and identity helpers into a dependency-neutral leaf, preserve compatibility by identity re-export, make package-attribute imports explicit, and add an AST graph guard with SCC detection plus synthetic false-negative fixtures. See section J.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```python
# (1) FUNCTION-LOCAL IMPORT — break a circular dep child→parent
# child module (utils/helpers.py); parent (logging/utils.py) already imports this child
def run_subprocess(cmd):
    from hephaestus.logging.utils import get_current_correlation_id  # local, not top-level
    cid = get_current_correlation_id()
    ...
```

```python
# (2) LAZY EXPORTS — extend public SDK surface without eager load
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from hephaestus.automation.ci_driver import CIDriver, CIDriverOptions

__all__ = ["Automation", "CIDriver", "CIDriverOptions"]  # alphabetical, case-sensitive

_LAZY_EXPORTS = {"CIDriver": "hephaestus.automation.ci_driver",
                 "CIDriverOptions": "hephaestus.automation.ci_driver"}
_PHASE_ENTRYPOINTS = ("hephaestus.automation.ci_driver",)  # guards eager-load preload
```

```python
# (3) VERSION-GATED STDLIB GUARD — 3.11+ module on a 3.10 matrix
import sys
if sys.version_info >= (3, 11):
    import tomllib
else:
    import tomli as tomllib  # type: ignore[no-redef]
```

```python
# (4) POSIX-ONLY STDLIB GUARD — keep package importable on Windows
try:
    import fcntl
except ModuleNotFoundError:  # Windows: fcntl is POSIX-only
    fcntl = None  # type: ignore[assignment]
```

```toml
# Conditional dependencies for the guards above (pyproject.toml)
[project]
dependencies = [
    "tomli; python_version < '3.11'",       # backport for (3)
    "tzdata; platform_system == 'Windows'", # zoneinfo data for (4)
]
```

```bash
# Audit for unguarded imports before patching
grep -rn "^import tomllib" hephaestus/ scripts/ tests/   # expect 0 after fix
grep -rn "^import \(curses\|fcntl\|termios\|grp\|pwd\)" hephaestus/  # each needs a guard
```

```bash
# (6) LAZY-EXPORT ADD/ADD REBASE CONFLICT — "CI failing" but no test failed
gh pr view <N> --json mergeStateStatus --jq .mergeStateStatus   # DIRTY → conflict, not a test
git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main                 # conflict localises to __init__.py
git show origin/main:hephaestus/automation/__init__.py | grep PRReviewer  # confirm main has it
#   → keep ONE copy of the shared _LAZY_EXPORTS entry; key ORDER is irrelevant (set()-based tests)
git rebase --continue
pixi run python -m pytest tests/ && pre-commit run --all-files  # ruff-format may reflow old lines
git commit -S -m "..."                                          # GPG (not SSH); key-email committer
git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD:<branch>                # rebase rewrote history
```

```bash
# (10) ADDED A SYMBOL TO __all__ → per-symbol COMPATIBILITY.md API-table test breaks (section G′)
# Failure: [missing-from-docs] hephaestus.cli.configure_cli_logging is in __all__ but has no row in COMPATIBILITY.md

# a) Find the package section in COMPATIBILITY.md (the per-symbol table header)
grep -n "### hephaestus.cli" COMPATIBILITY.md            # locate the right '### <pkg>' section

# b) See the alphabetical neighbours so you insert in the RIGHT position
grep -nA40 "### hephaestus.cli" COMPATIBILITY.md | grep '^[0-9].*| `'   # rows are ALPHABETICAL by symbol
#   → configure_cli_logging goes between add_version_arg and configure_github_throttle_from_args

# c) Resolve the "since" version from SAME-CYCLE SIBLINGS, not the latest tag
git describe --tags --abbrev=0                            # e.g. v0.9.7 — do NOT just use 0.9.8 from this
grep -nE "create_validation_parser|resolve_repo_root" COMPATIBILITY.md  # siblings added this cycle → 0.9.8
#   → row: | configure_cli_logging | 0.9.8 | Configure standard stderr-safe logging for a CLI |

# d) AUTHORITATIVE check — run the WHOLE module (isolated run is a FALSE NEGATIVE):
pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py -q --no-cov
#   NOT: pytest …::test_real_compatibility_md_is_aligned alone (can pass with the bug present)

# e) markdownlint the doc you edited
markdownlint-cli2 COMPATIBILITY.md
```

### Detailed Steps

#### A. Function-local imports to avoid coupling / circular deps

1. **Diagnose the cycle.** Confirm the parent already imports the child:
   ```bash
   grep -r "^from hephaestus.utils" hephaestus/logging/   # parent imports child?
   grep -r "^from hephaestus.logging" hephaestus/utils/   # child imports parent at top-level? → cycle
   ```
2. **Move the import into the function** that needs the ambient state:
   ```python
   def run_subprocess(cmd: list[str]) -> str:
       """Run subprocess, injecting correlation ID into environment.

       Note: import is inside the function to avoid a circular dependency
       with hephaestus.logging (which imports from hephaestus.utils).
       """
       from hephaestus.logging.utils import get_current_correlation_id
       env = os.environ.copy()
       if cid := get_current_correlation_id():
           env["GH_TRACE_ID"] = cid
       ...
   ```
3. **Keep the function where it semantically belongs** — move the *import*, not the function. Do not relocate `get_current_correlation_id()` into `utils` just to dodge the edge (that creates a god-module / SRP violation).
4. **Accept the cost.** First call pays an import lookup (~1–5µs); subsequent calls hit `sys.modules` (negligible). For subprocess spawning the import is ~1,000,000x cheaper than the spawn itself.
5. **Prefer function-local imports over threading a parameter** through intermediate functions that don't use it — that is what ambient context (contextvars/logging/config) is for. Reserve parameters for true call-level arguments.

#### B. Lazy exports to widen an SDK surface safely

1. **Identify peer classes** in submodules that belong in the public SDK but are missing from `__all__` (follow `PeerClass` + `PeerClassOptions` naming).
2. **Extend the `TYPE_CHECKING` block** with conditional imports (alphabetical; import class + Options together) so type hints resolve without eager loading.
3. **Update `__all__`** — add every entry, sorted alphabetically case-sensitively (uppercase first), each appearing exactly once.
4. **Extend `_LAZY_EXPORTS`** — map each name → module path string; the package `__getattr__` resolves these on first access. Keep keys alphabetically sorted.
5. **Guard new phase modules in `_PHASE_ENTRYPOINTS`** — add the module path to the tuple so `_auto_import_on_access()` skips eager preload, preventing eager-load regressions and import-time bloat.
6. **Add a surface-pinning test** (extend the existing `test_package_imports.py`, do not create a parallel file):
   ```python
   def test_public_surface_pins_expected_symbols() -> None:
       from hephaestus.automation import __all__
       expected = {"AddressReviewer", "AddressReviewerOptions", "CIDriver",
                   "CIDriverOptions", "PlanReviewer", "PlanReviewerOptions"}
       missing = expected - set(__all__)
       assert not missing, f"Missing peer classes in __all__: {missing}"
   ```
7. **Validate**: `pixi run pytest tests/unit/automation/ -v && pixi run ruff check ... && pixi run mypy ...`.
8. **Prefer a subset assertion (`expected - set(__all__)`) over strict equality (`set(__all__) == expected`)** for the pin. A subset assertion (`missing = expected - set(__all__); assert not missing`) catches *removed* peers (the regression you care about) but tolerates a new peer being added on `main` via an independent PR. A strict-equality pin breaks every open branch the moment any peer lands elsewhere (see section B′). If you must keep strict equality, treat the literal as a manifest that has to be re-synced on rebase.

#### B2. Resolving a lazy-export add/add rebase conflict (sibling PR landed the same widening first)

Symptom: the PR reads as "CI failing", but `gh run view` shows only runner/setup steps and **no test failure**. The real blocker is a merge conflict, not a test.

1. **Diagnose before touching CI.** When a PR is reported CI-failing with no failing test in the logs, run `gh pr view <N> --json mergeStateStatus` FIRST. `DIRTY` (or `CONFLICTING`) means a merge conflict — not a test — blocks the merge. Don't re-run CI; rebase.
2. **Fetch and rebase** onto the advanced main: `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`. The conflict localises to `__init__.py`'s `_LAZY_EXPORTS` dict where both branches added the *same* export line (e.g. both added `"PRReviewer": "hephaestus.automation.pr_reviewer"`).
3. **Keep ONE copy.** Both sides want the identical line — delete the duplicate, keep a single entry. Verify main already carries it: `git show origin/main:hephaestus/automation/__init__.py | grep PRReviewer`.
4. **Don't fight dict key ORDER.** The surface-pinning tests use `set()` equality and `<=` subset checks (see `test_public_surface_pins_expected_symbols`), so `_LAZY_EXPORTS` / `__all__` key order does not affect pass/fail. A richer branch-side `EXPECTED_PUBLIC_SYMBOLS` identity test coexists with main's test — no dedup needed.
5. **Continue and re-verify**: `git rebase --continue`, then run the FULL suite (`pixi run python -m pytest tests/`) — a surface change can ripple. Then `pre-commit run --all-files`: **ruff-format may reformat a line that was fine on the old base** (e.g. collapse a multi-line f-string assertion). Re-run pre-commit until clean and commit the format fix with `git commit -S` (committer email MUST be the GPG key's email, e.g. `4211002+mvillmow@users.noreply.github.com`, or pr-policy signing fails; use the default GPG format, NOT SSH — SSH-signed commits can trip a false-NOGO in the automation reviewer when local git can't verify them without an `allowedSignersFile`).
6. **Push needs `--force-with-lease`** because the rebase rewrote history.
7. **Stale/duplicate-issue smell**: if main *already* contains the change your branch was trying to make, the branch may be partly redundant — but its test improvements can still be worth keeping. Keep the richer tests, drop only the now-duplicate production change.

#### B′. Repairing a stale surface-pin test after a parallel-PR peer landed

A strict-equality surface pin (`assert set(automation.__all__) == expected`) fails on CI with `Extra items in the left set: '<Symbol>'` when `<Symbol>` was added to `__all__` on `main` by an independent PR while your branch was open. The source is correct; the *test literal* is the stale party. Procedure:

1. **Confirm the failure is real and isolate the symbol.** `gh pr view <pr> --json state,statusCheckRollup` to confirm OPEN + which checks fail (here: `unit-tests` on every Python leg). Then `gh run view --job <id> --log-failed | grep -iE "FAILED|AssertionError"` to find the single failing test among thousands. The pytest set-diff (`Extra items in the left set: '<Symbol>'`) names the exact symbol.
2. **Decide test-vs-source before editing either** — the critical step. Prove whether `<Symbol>` is a legitimate export or an accidental addition:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -- hephaestus/automation/__init__.py     # when/how did <Symbol> enter __all__?
   git log -p -1 -- hephaestus/automation/__init__.py          # the landing commit + its PR/message
   ```
   If `<Symbol>` landed via a separate, legitimate feature PR on `main` (e.g. `AuditReviewer` via #1067), the **test is stale, not the source**. Do NOT remove `<Symbol>` from `__all__` — that would silently shrink the public surface.
3. **Fix the test literal only.** Add `<Symbol>` to the `expected` set, alphabetically placed. Zero production code changes.
4. **Discriminate real CI failures from live-session environment noise.** A full *local* suite run inside a live Claude Code automation session can show extra failures that CI does not. Two cheap discriminators:
   ```bash
   # (a) env-var leakage (e.g. HEPH_*_MODEL set in the live session):
   env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="$PATH" pixi run pytest <path>::<test> -q   # PASS under env -i ⇒ environmental
   # (b) your-change-vs-pre-existing: stash your diff, re-run on the clean base:
   git stash && pixi run pytest <path> -q ; git stash pop            # still fails ⇒ pre-existing, not yours
   ```
   Decisive tiebreaker: `gh run view --job <id> --log | grep <testname>` — if the test **PASSED in CI**, the local failure is environment-only (CI has no live `gh` auth and no `HEPH_*_MODEL` env vars). Lesson: when the local suite shows MORE failures than CI, verify each against the CI log before attributing any of them to your change.
5. **Harden the pin** so the next parallel PR doesn't re-break it: switch the assertion to a subset check (step 8 above), or accept that the strict literal is a manifest requiring a rebase-time re-sync.

#### C. Version-gated stdlib import guard (newer-Python module on older matrix)

1. **Audit**: `grep -rn "^import tomllib" hephaestus/ scripts/ tests/`.
2. **Replace each bare import** with a `sys.version_info` guard (mypy narrows on this; a bare `try/except` does not):
   ```python
   import sys
   if sys.version_info >= (3, 11):
       import tomllib
   else:
       import tomli as tomllib  # type: ignore[no-redef]
   ```
3. **Declare the backport** as a conditional dependency in `pyproject.toml` (`"tomli; python_version < '3.11'"`) and, if used, `pixi.toml` (`tomli = { version = ">=2.0", python = "<3.11" }`).
4. **Run** `pixi run pytest tests/unit` and confirm collection succeeds on both the lowest and highest Python in the matrix.
5. **If mypy on 3.11+ flags the redefinition or an unused ignore**, use `# type: ignore[no-redef, unused-ignore]` on the `else`-branch import.

General pattern + known backports:

| Module | Added in | Backport package |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| `tomllib` | 3.11 | `tomli` |
| `ExceptionGroup` | 3.11 | `exceptiongroup` |
| `importlib.resources` (new API) | 3.9 | `importlib_resources` |
| `zoneinfo` | 3.9 | `backports.zoneinfo` |
| `graphlib` | 3.9 | `graphlib_backport` |

#### D. POSIX-only stdlib guards for Windows CI

1. **Find every POSIX-only import**: `curses`, `fcntl`, `termios`, `grp`, `pwd`, `resource`, `syslog`, `readline`. Each needs a guard.
2. **Wrap at module top-level** with `try/except ModuleNotFoundError` (only this exception — never bare `except:`) and assign `None`:
   ```python
   try:
       import curses
   except ModuleNotFoundError:  # Windows: curses not bundled with CPython
       curses = None  # type: ignore[assignment]
   ```
3. **Move the "unavailable" error to runtime** (class `__init__` / function entry), not import time, so the package imports cleanly on Windows and only the POSIX path raises.
4. **Guard every call site** with `if <module> is not None:`; treat absent locks as best-effort no-ops:
   ```python
   def _acquire_lock(fp) -> None:
       if fcntl is not None:
           fcntl.flock(fp.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
       # else: cross-process locking is a best-effort no-op on Windows
   ```
5. **For `zoneinfo`**: add `"tzdata; platform_system == 'Windows'"` to `[project].dependencies`; `ZoneInfo` discovers the wheel automatically.
6. **Scope tests honestly**: runtime guards make the package *importable* on Windows, not the POSIX-only CLIs *functional*. Skip those tests on Windows via `pytest.skip(...)` rather than scattering inline `if sys.platform == "win32"` assertions.
7. **Track the full cross-OS port as a separate issue** (file-mode bits, path encoding, coredump handlers). Keep the matrix ubuntu-only until that lands; keep the import guards so downstream consumers stay Windows-importable.

#### F. Verified Workflow — adding an access-time DeprecationWarning across the PEP 562 lazy-loader seam (verified-local)

> **Verification:** This workflow was executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus issue #1545 (warn at *access* time, not only call time, for the deprecated `retry_with_jitter` shim exposed via `hephaestus/__init__.py`'s PEP 562 `__getattr__` loader). All steps below are verified locally — tests pass, ruff and mypy clean. CI confirmation pending after the ProjectHephaestus PR merges. Verification level = `verified-local`.

1. **Grep the named symbol against the source BEFORE trusting the issue's structural claim.** Issue #1545 said the shim was "in `__all__`", but `retry_with_jitter` is actually only in `_LAZY_IMPORTS` (the lazy resolver map), not `__all__`. The fix location — the `__getattr__` lazy-loader seam — is the same either way, but you must understand where the symbol actually lives before editing.
   ```bash
   grep -n "retry_with_jitter" hephaestus/__init__.py   # is it in _LAZY_IMPORTS or __all__? (here: _LAZY_IMPORTS only)
   grep -rn "def retry_with_jitter" hephaestus/         # where the real impl + any call-time warning lives
   ```

2. **Treat access-time and call-time warnings as COMPLEMENTARY layers, not duplicates — keep both.** A deprecated shim may already warn *inside its function body* (fires on `hephaestus.utils.X` direct call). Adding a warning in the package `__getattr__` covers a *different* access path — binding `hephaestus.X` via attribute lookup, even if the symbol is never called. Different users hit different paths; do NOT "dedup" them.

3. **Add a `_DEPRECATED_LAZY` dict alongside `_LAZY_IMPORTS` and check it inside `__getattr__`.** The warning message should name the canonical replacement. Defer the `import warnings` inside the condition — it is stdlib, safe, and does not breach the automation boundary (`test_automation_boundary.py` confirmed):
   ```python
   # hephaestus/__init__.py — add after _LAZY_IMPORTS closes
   _DEPRECATED_LAZY: dict[str, str] = {
       "retry_with_jitter": (
           "hephaestus.retry_with_jitter is deprecated; use "
           "retry_with_backoff(jitter=True, max_delay=...) instead. "
           "It will be removed no earlier than the next major version after 1.0."
       ),
   }

   def __getattr__(name: str) -> Any:
       """Lazy-load public symbols on first access (PEP 562)."""
       if name in _LAZY_IMPORTS:
           if name in _DEPRECATED_LAZY:
               import warnings
               warnings.warn(_DEPRECATED_LAZY[name], DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
           module_name, attr = _LAZY_IMPORTS[name]
           import importlib
           module = importlib.import_module(module_name)
           value = getattr(module, attr)
           globals()[name] = value
           return value
       raise AttributeError(f"module 'hephaestus' has no attribute {name!r}")
   ```

4. **`stacklevel=2` IS correct for `__getattr__` — verified.** The call stack when a user writes `hephaestus.retry_with_jitter` is: (1) user's access line → (2) `__getattr__` → (3) `warnings.warn`. `stacklevel=2` skips `__getattr__` (frame 2) and attributes the warning to frame 1 (the user's line). Confirmed by asserting `access_warnings[0].filename == __file__` in the test.

5. **Force a fresh resolve in the regression test — PEP 562 `__getattr__` caches into module globals.** After the first `hephaestus.retry_with_jitter` access, the resolved name is written into the module's `__dict__`, so `__getattr__` (and the access warning) never runs again that process. A prior test that already touched the symbol makes the warning assertion a false-negative. Pop it first:
   ```python
   def test_retry_with_jitter_access_emits_deprecation_warning(self) -> None:
       import hephaestus

       # Bust PEP 562 cache — force __getattr__ to re-run
       hephaestus.__dict__.pop("retry_with_jitter", None)

       with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as caught:
           warnings.simplefilter("always")
           symbol = hephaestus.retry_with_jitter  # ACCESS only, do not call

       assert callable(symbol)
       access_warnings = [w for w in caught if issubclass(w.category, DeprecationWarning)]
       assert access_warnings, "Accessing hephaestus.retry_with_jitter must emit DeprecationWarning"
       assert "retry_with_jitter" in str(access_warnings[0].message)
       # stacklevel=2 must attribute the warning to the caller's file
       assert access_warnings[0].filename == __file__, (
           f"DeprecationWarning should be attributed to the caller's file "
           f"({__file__}); got {access_warnings[0].filename}. Check stacklevel."
       )
   ```

6. **Grep for stale-tolerant tests that ASSERT the about-to-change behavior, then REWRITE them — a change is not "additive" if a passing test documents the old contract.** The existing test `test_retry_with_jitter_reachable_from_top_level_lazy_loader` explicitly documented and tolerated the silent lazy resolve ("the lazy resolve itself is silent; only CALLING warns"). It had to be replaced, not supplemented — its docstring said the old behavior was intentional.
   ```bash
   grep -rn "silent\|lazy resolve\|only CALLING\|does not warn" tests/ | grep -i deprecat
   ```

7. **Update the prose deprecation doc in the SAME PR — behavior/doc drift is a review trap.** `COMPATIBILITY.md` had a bullet stating the warning fires "when called". Update it to reflect that the warning now fires both when accessed via `hephaestus.retry_with_jitter` AND when called.

8. **Re-confirm the import-surface boundary still holds.** Adding `import warnings` inside `__getattr__` is low-risk (`warnings` is stdlib, deferred inside the condition), but run `test_import_surface.py` and `test_automation_boundary.py` after the change — both passed for issue #1545.

#### G. Promoting undeclared public-looking symbols to the package surface (audit-finding fix) — verified-local for __all__ alignment; unverified for COMPATIBILITY.md version-stamping

> **Verification:** `verified-local` for `__all__` alignment, eager re-export, subset-assertion pin, and import-surface/boundary boundary checks — these steps were executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus issue #1511 (`hephaestus/cli/__init__.py` aligned with `hephaestus/cli/utils.py`; 79 tests passed; mypy/ruff/test_import_surface/test_automation_boundary all clean). COMPATIBILITY.md version-stamping guidance remains `unverified` — derived from a plan for ProjectHephaestus issue #1513, not yet executed in CI.

When you fix a defect where symbols are declared in a submodule `__all__` but not re-exported from the package `__init__.py`, the symbol-level diff is tiny but the verification blast radius is not. Work through these checks BEFORE writing the plan as fact:

**Verified concrete example (ProjectHephaestus issue #1511 — `hephaestus/cli/__init__.py`):**

```python
# hephaestus/cli/__init__.py — BEFORE (missing 4 symbols from utils.py __all__)
from hephaestus.cli.utils import (
    Colors,
    add_json_arg,
    # ... other symbols already present
)
__all__ = ["Colors", "add_json_arg", ...]

# hephaestus/cli/__init__.py — AFTER (eager re-export; stdlib-only module → no lazy machinery)
from hephaestus.cli.utils import (
    Colors,
    DRY_RUN_HELP_CAVEAT,          # string constant
    add_dry_run_arg,               # argparse helper
    add_github_throttle_args,      # argparse helper
    add_json_arg,
    configure_github_throttle_from_args,  # argparse helper
    # ... other symbols
)
__all__ = [
    "Colors",
    "DRY_RUN_HELP_CAVEAT",
    "add_dry_run_arg",
    "add_github_throttle_args",
    "add_json_arg",
    "configure_github_throttle_from_args",
    # ...
]
```

```python
# tests/unit/cli/test_utils.py — AFTER: subset-assertion pin + identity check
import hephaestus.cli as cli
import hephaestus.cli.utils as utils

def test_cli_all_covers_module_all() -> None:
    """Subset assertion: every symbol in utils.__all__ must appear in cli.__all__."""
    missing = set(utils.__all__) - set(cli.__all__)
    assert not missing, f"cli.__all__ is missing symbols from utils.__all__: {missing}"

def test_dry_run_symbols_reexport_identity() -> None:
    """Re-exported symbols must be the SAME object (identity, not just equality)."""
    assert cli.add_dry_run_arg is utils.add_dry_run_arg
    assert cli.DRY_RUN_HELP_CAVEAT is utils.DRY_RUN_HELP_CAVEAT
```

Key verified decisions from issue #1511:

- **Scope expansion is intentional**: the issue named 2 symbols; audit found the SAME defect class applied to 4. Fix all 4 so `set(utils.__all__) == set(cli.__all__)` — a partial fix re-triggers the same audit finding for the skipped symbols.
- **Eager re-export beats lazy when the module is stdlib-only**: `cli/utils.py` imports only `argparse`, `json`, `math`, `sys`, `hephaestus._version_lookup`. No `_LAZY_EXPORTS` infrastructure needed; plain `from hephaestus.cli.utils import (…)` in `__init__.py` is correct.
- **No COMPATIBILITY.md change**: `hephaestus.cli` appears only as a tier-level Stable entry at line 53; there is no per-symbol table. Nothing to update.
- **Subset assertion, not strict equality**: `set(utils.__all__) - set(cli.__all__)` catches regressions (removed symbols) but tolerates parallel PRs that add new symbols. A strict-equality pin would break the moment any sibling PR lands a new symbol.
- **Verify import-surface/boundary after any `__init__.py` widening**: `test_import_surface.py` and `test_automation_boundary.py` both passed after widening `cli/__init__.py` (no heavyweight or boundary-crossing imports were introduced).

Additional planning steps (from a plan for ProjectHephaestus issue #1513 — unverified for COMPATIBILITY.md version-stamping):

1. **Verify the COMPATIBILITY.md "Added" version against the ACTUAL next release — never guess it from the latest tag.** `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` returning `v0.9.7` does NOT mean the next release is `0.9.8`; the next version could be `0.9.8`, `0.10.0`, or `1.0.0` depending on cadence/roadmap. Stamping the wrong version silently mis-documents the stability contract. Either resolve the real target version, or flag it explicitly for the reviewer:
   ```bash
   git -C <repo> describe --tags --abbrev=0          # latest tag — NOT necessarily next version
   sed -n '1,80p' docs/RELEASING.md                  # documented release cadence / next-version policy
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --jq '.[].title'  # an open milestone often names the target version
   ```
   If none of these resolve the next version unambiguously, write the plan with an explicit "**reviewer must confirm the target release version for the COMPATIBILITY.md 'Added' column**" callout rather than asserting a guessed number.

2. **Grep the WHOLE test tree for an existing strict-equality surface pin BEFORE widening `__all__` — the breakage is non-local.** A strict-equality pin (`assert set(pkg.__all__) == {literal}`) for the target package may live in a *different* test file than the one you are editing. If it exists, adding three symbols to `__all__` breaks THAT test, and a plan that only touches the obvious test file misses it. Grep by package name AND `__all__` AND surface/pin/expected markers across all of `tests/`:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "logging" tests/ | grep -iE "__all__|surface|pin|expected"   # find ANY pin for this package
   grep -rn "__all__" tests/ | grep -iE "==|expected|surface|pin"        # strict-equality pins anywhere
   ```
   A widening change has a non-local test blast radius — enumerate every pin that references the package, not just the test file you planned to edit.

3. **Verify the audit's stability-tier premise on disk — an audit finding's premise is itself a claim to check.** The whole fix here rests on "`hephaestus.logging` is Stable (COMPATIBILITY.md:56)". Read the actual stability-tier source and confirm the tier before building the fix around it; audit findings are sometimes factually wrong (team KB has prior cases of 3/29 strict-audit findings being factually wrong). If the subpackage is NOT actually a Stable tier, the entire "promote to stable surface" framing is wrong.
   ```bash
   grep -n "logging" COMPATIBILITY.md | grep -iE "stable|tier|experimental|deprecated"  # confirm the tier
   ```

4. **Assert re-export IDENTITY and grep for existing submodule patch paths.** When re-exporting symbols that existing tests `monkeypatch`/`mock.patch` via the submodule path, the package-root re-export MUST be the SAME object so either patch path works. Add a test asserting identity (`pkg.set_correlation_id is utils.set_correlation_id`) and grep for any test that patches the submodule path to confirm none rely on a divergent binding:
   ```bash
   grep -rn 'patch("hephaestus.logging.utils' tests/    # any monkeypatch on the submodule path?
   grep -rn "set_correlation_id\|get_current_correlation_id\|correlation_id_scope" tests/
   ```

5. **Include the import-surface/boundary tests in the verification set for ANY `__init__.py` widening — even a "pure re-export".** Adding eager re-exports to a package `__init__.py` can regress an enforced import-surface or boundary test (`test_import_surface.py`, `test_automation_boundary.py`) if the re-exported submodule pulls a heavyweight or boundary-crossing import. The plan reasoned `utils.py` only pulls stdlib + `hephaestus.constants` + formatters, which is safe — but that reasoning is a hypothesis until those tests run. Always run them after touching an `__init__.py`:
   ```bash
   pixi run pytest tests/unit/validation/test_import_surface.py tests/unit/validation/test_automation_boundary.py -q
   ```

Note on the pin choice: when ADDING the surface-pin test for the promoted symbols, prefer a subset assertion (`expected - set(__all__)`, see section B step 8) over a strict-equality pin, so this same widening pattern doesn't break future parallel branches.

#### G′. Keeping a per-symbol COMPATIBILITY.md API table aligned when you widen `__all__` — and the FULL-SUITE-ONLY live-tree-scan hazard (verified-local)

> **Verification:** `verified-local`. Executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus issue #1419 (added `configure_cli_logging` to `hephaestus/cli/utils.py:__all__` and re-exported it from `hephaestus/cli/__init__.py:__all__`). All affected tests pass locally: `tests/unit/cli/test_utils.py`, `tests/unit/automation/test_ensure_state_labels.py`, and `tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py` (3186 passed after the doc-row fix); ruff clean; `pixi run mypy` = "Success: no issues found in 446 source files"; `markdownlint-cli2` on `COMPATIBILITY.md` passed. Verified locally; CI confirmation pending on the originating PR. This section also UPGRADES the previously-`unverified` issue #1513 COMPATIBILITY.md version-stamping guidance to `verified-local`: the version column IS resolved from same-cycle siblings (confirmed on disk).

When a repo enforces a *per-symbol* `COMPATIBILITY.md` API table with a **live-tree-scanning** validation test (e.g. ProjectHephaestus `tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py`), adding a name to a package `__all__` is NOT a no-op for docs — unlike section G's `hephaestus.cli` *tier-level* entry, the `### hephaestus.cli` section in this repo has a per-symbol table, and every name in `cli.__all__` MUST have a matching row.

**The failure (verified):** adding `configure_cli_logging` to `hephaestus/cli/utils.py:__all__` and re-exporting it in `hephaestus/cli/__init__.py:__all__` produced:

```text
[missing-from-docs] hephaestus.cli.configure_cli_logging is in __all__ but has no row in COMPATIBILITY.md
```

raised by `TestLiveTreeAlignment::test_real_compatibility_md_is_aligned` (and the parallel `TestMain::test_main_returns_zero_on_real_repo`).

1. **Add an ALPHABETICAL row to the matching `### <pkg>` section.** Rows are sorted by symbol name within each package section. `configure_cli_logging` belongs between `add_version_arg` and `configure_github_throttle_from_args`:
   ```markdown
   | `add_version_arg` | 0.1.0 | Add a `--version` flag to a parser |
   | `configure_cli_logging` | 0.9.8 | Configure standard stderr-safe logging for a CLI |
   | `configure_github_throttle_from_args` | 0.9.0 | Apply parsed throttle args to the GitHub client |
   ```

2. **Resolve the "since" version from SAME-CYCLE SIBLINGS, not the latest tag (verified — upgrades the issue #1513 caveat).** `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` returned `v0.9.7`. The correct "since" was `0.9.8`, but the reason is NOT "latest tag + 1" — it is that sibling helpers added in the same release cycle (`create_validation_parser`, `resolve_repo_root`) already carry `0.9.8` in the table. Read the version off the siblings, not the tag arithmetic:
   ```bash
   git describe --tags --abbrev=0                                   # v0.9.7 — latest tag, NOT the answer
   grep -nE "create_validation_parser|resolve_repo_root" COMPATIBILITY.md  # siblings this cycle → 0.9.8
   ```
   (Issue #1513 flagged this as an unverified "never guess from the tag" caution; issue #1419 confirms the resolution rule: match the same-cycle siblings.)

3. **THE FULL-SUITE-ONLY HAZARD — an isolated run is a FALSE NEGATIVE.** The live-tree test scans the actual on-disk `__all__` + `COMPATIBILITY.md` at scan time (not per-test fixtures). Empirically (issue #1419): running the two tests IN ISOLATION (`pytest …::test_real_compatibility_md_is_aligned` alone) PASSED even with the broken change present in some orderings, and passed on a stashed/clean tree. The failure reliably reproduced only when running the WHOLE `test_api_table_docs.py` module (or the broad `tests/unit/validation` suite) WITH the change applied. The authoritative check is the full module:
   ```bash
   pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py -q --no-cov
   ```
   General rule: **for any live-tree-scanning validation test, a clean isolated run is a false negative — run the full owning module before claiming green.** This applies after editing ANY package `__all__` or any `[project.scripts]`/public-export surface, not just this one symbol.

4. **markdownlint the doc.** `markdownlint-cli2 COMPATIBILITY.md` (the table edit must stay lint-clean).

5. **Secondary (cross-link to `dry-refactoring-workflow`, do NOT duplicate): a stale issue body / plan can instruct you to reverse already-merged code.** The issue #1419 body + approved plan predated sibling PR #1637, which had ALREADY merged most of the work with a WIDER `create_validation_parser` API. The plan said to give `create_validation_parser` a NARROW API (drop `include_repo_root`, `prog`, `usage`, `epilog`, `formatter_class`), but #1637 KEPT those knobs and many call sites now depend on them (`include_repo_root=False`, `prog=`, `epilog=`, `usage=`, `formatter_class=`). The correct move was NOT to reverse merged code; only the genuinely-unimplemented slice remained (the `configure_cli_logging` helper + an `ensure_state_labels.py` logging swap). This reinforces the existing `dry-refactoring-workflow` rule: **grep the CURRENT state of the code; issue bodies and approved plans go stale once a sibling PR merges.** See that skill for the full stale-plan-audit procedure — this is only a pointer.

#### H. Adding the companion `__dir__()` to a PEP 562 lazy-loader package — UNVERIFIED planning-guidance

> **Verification:** `unverified`. These steps were derived from an implementation *plan* for ProjectHephaestus issue #1512 — an `[S14 API Design]` audit finding that `hephaestus/__init__.py` implements PEP 562 `__getattr__` for lazy loading but omits the companion `__dir__()`, so `dir(hephaestus)` shows only ~4 eagerly-bound names and the entire lazily-loaded public API is invisible to introspection tools (IPython tab-completion, IDEs, doc generators). The plan adds a module-level `__dir__()` returning `sorted(set(_LAZY_IMPORTS) | set(__all__) | set(globals()))` and pins it with a `TestDirDiscoverability` class in the existing `tests/integration/test_package_import.py`. The plan has **not** been executed in CI; treat every step below as a checklist to confirm, not a verified outcome.

PEP 562 pairs `__dir__` with `__getattr__` for discoverability. A package that defines a module-level `__getattr__` for lazy loading should also define a module-level `__dir__() -> list[str]`, or `dir(pkg)` shows only the eagerly-bound names and the entire lazy public API is invisible to tab-completion, IDEs, and doc generators. This is a POLA/discoverability defect, not a correctness bug — the symbols still *resolve* on access; they are just not *listed*. Work through these checks BEFORE writing the plan as fact:

1. **A custom module `__dir__` REPLACES the default listing — it does NOT merge.** `dir(module)` uses ONLY the value your `__dir__` returns; it does not auto-union the module globals the way the default `dir()` does. So you MUST explicitly fold `globals()` into the return, or you will REMOVE names that are visible today (`__version__`, `__author__`, dunders, and any already-resolved-and-cached lazy names that PEP 562 wrote into `__dict__`) — a silent regression. This is the single most important and most easily-missed point. The correct return is the UNION of all three sources:
   ```python
   # hephaestus/__init__.py — add alongside __getattr__
   def __dir__() -> list[str]:
       """List lazily-loaded public symbols for tab-completion / introspection (PEP 562)."""
       return sorted(set(_LAZY_IMPORTS) | set(__all__) | set(globals()))
   ```
   Returning only `sorted(set(_LAZY_IMPORTS) | set(__all__))` (forgetting `globals()`) is the classic bug — it drops `__version__`, `__author__`, dunders, and already-cached lazy names, so `dir()` SHRINKS versus today.

2. **`__dir__` returns names (strings) only — it performs NO attribute access — so it triggers no lazy import and fires no access-time warning.** Critically, a deprecated lazy shim (e.g. `retry_with_jitter`, the section F symbol) can be SAFELY listed in `__dir__` output WITHOUT emitting its `DeprecationWarning`, because listing a name ≠ accessing it. The plan asserts this in a test: `dir()` emits no `DeprecationWarning` AND does not populate the symbol into `__dict__`. This connects directly to section F — the access-time warning fires only on attribute *access* through `__getattr__`, and `__dir__` never goes through `__getattr__`.
   ```python
   def test_dir_does_not_emit_deprecation_warning(self) -> None:
       import hephaestus
       hephaestus.__dict__.pop("retry_with_jitter", None)  # ensure not pre-cached
       with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as caught:
           warnings.simplefilter("always")
           names = dir(hephaestus)
       assert "retry_with_jitter" in names                 # listed
       assert not [w for w in caught if issubclass(w.category, DeprecationWarning)]
       assert "retry_with_jitter" not in hephaestus.__dict__  # listing did not resolve it
   ```

3. **Pin the contract by SUBSET INVARIANT, not by count.** The audit snapshot said "35 symbols"; the live surface had already grown to 40 `_LAZY_IMPORTS` entries by fix-time. Assert the subset invariant (`set(_LAZY_IMPORTS) <= set(dir(pkg))` and `set(__all__) <= set(dir(pkg))`), never a hardcoded count — counts go stale exactly like the strict-equality `__all__` pins warned about in sections B / B′. Extend the existing surface test file (`tests/integration/test_package_import.py`); do NOT create a parallel one.
   ```python
   def test_dir_exposes_all_lazy_symbols(self) -> None:
       import hephaestus
       visible = set(dir(hephaestus))
       assert set(hephaestus._LAZY_IMPORTS) <= visible   # subset invariant, not == count
       assert set(hephaestus.__all__) <= visible
   ```

4. **Regression-test that `dir()` does not SHRINK the visible set** — assert previously-visible names like `__version__` / `__author__` remain. Because the replace-not-merge behavior in step 1 makes accidental shrinkage the primary failure mode, this guard is what catches a future refactor that drops `set(globals())` from the return:
   ```python
   def test_dir_does_not_shrink_visible_surface(self) -> None:
       import hephaestus
       visible = set(dir(hephaestus))
       assert {"__version__", "__author__"} <= visible   # eagerly-bound names must stay listed
   ```

5. **Audit-snapshot counts drift between finding-time and fix-time — verify the live surface on disk before quoting any count.** The "35 symbols" in the audit finding was already stale (real = 40 `_LAZY_IMPORTS` entries). An audit finding's premise is itself a claim to check (consistent with section G step 3 and the team-KB lesson that strict-audit findings are sometimes factually wrong). Confirm the live count before relying on it, and never bake it into a test:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import hephaestus; print(len(hephaestus._LAZY_IMPORTS), len(hephaestus.__all__))"
   ```

#### I. Retiring obsolete compatibility branches and enforcing canonical resolvers — UNVERIFIED planning-guidance

> **Warning:** This workflow has not been validated end-to-end. It was derived from a
> ProjectHephaestus implementation plan; no code changes, tests, or CI results were observed.

Compatibility policy must follow the repository's **current declared support contract**, not
the historical Python version that existed when a guard was added.

```bash
# Read the contract before editing imports.
rg -n 'requires-python|Programming Language :: Python :: 3' pyproject.toml
rg -n 'python-version|python_version|3\.(8|9|10|11|12|13)' .github pyproject.toml

# Inventory policy bypasses and obsolete backports.
rg -n 'import_tomllib|tomllib|tomli|backports\.zoneinfo|from zoneinfo' \
  --glob '*.py' src/ tests/
```

Use this decision order:

1. **Prove the floor.** Check `requires-python`, classifiers, CI matrices, and any runtime
   packaging constraints. A classifier alone is weaker evidence than `requires-python` plus
   CI. In the motivating plan, Python 3.13 is required, so both `tomllib` and `zoneinfo` are
   guaranteed stdlib modules.
2. **Distinguish import compatibility from runtime data.** Removing a
   `backports.zoneinfo` import branch does not imply removing `tzdata`. `ZoneInfo` is stdlib,
   while Windows may still need the IANA timezone database supplied by `tzdata`.
3. **Honor an existing resolver seam.** If the codebase already owns import policy in a
   helper such as `import_tomllib()`, route every production consumer through it even when the
   current floor guarantees the stdlib implementation. The helper is the canonical policy
   owner and a deterministic unit-test seam; scattered direct imports recreate drift.
4. **Use direct stdlib imports when no shared policy seam is needed.** With Python 3.13 as
   the enforced floor, `from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo` is clearer than an unreachable
   `try/except ImportError` fallback to `backports.zoneinfo`.
5. **Pin both the policy and the absence of stale code.** Resolver-seam tests should replace
   the helper with a fake parser and feed invalid source, proving the consumer did not parse
   directly. A source assertion or `rg` check should prove the obsolete backport string is gone.

Resolver-seam test shape:

```python
def test_consumer_uses_shared_toml_resolver(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    (tmp_path / "pyproject.toml").write_text("not parsed directly")
    parser = SimpleNamespace(loads=lambda _source: {"project": {"scripts": {"x": "y"}}})
    monkeypatch.setattr(module_under_test, "import_tomllib", lambda: parser)

    assert module_under_test._load_scripts(tmp_path) == {"x"}
```

The deliberate asymmetry is the key: `tomllib` consumers use the existing canonical helper;
`ZoneInfo` imports directly because the Python floor guarantees it and no shared resolver owns
a broader policy. Do not preserve an unreachable backport merely for symmetry.

#### J. Whole-package AST import graph and neutral-leaf cycle repair — UNVERIFIED planning-guidance

> **Warning:** This workflow has not been validated end-to-end. Treat it as a hypothesis until
> implementation tests and CI confirm it. It was derived from the reviewed ProjectHephaestus
> issue #2363 plan; the current tree did not yet contain the proposed `git_runtime.py` or graph

Use this workflow when a cycle crosses several kinds of runtime edge and a simple forbidden-prefix
scan is too weak. The repair and the guard are one atomic contract: dependency ownership changes
remove the current cycle, while the graph test prevents a different path from recreating it.

1. **Reconstruct the first reported cycle against the current tree.** Audit reports and line
   numbers go stale. Confirm every named module still exists and every edge still resolves before
   editing. If an historical edge was already replaced, preserve that production replacement and
   add an exact cold-import regression for both import orders; do not recreate a deleted shim or
   introduce a second construction path merely to match the old report.

2. **Move only dependency-neutral behavior into a leaf module.** Subprocess execution, repository
   identity parsing, caches, cache clearing, and reference formatting can live below higher-level
   Git and GitHub orchestration. The leaf must not import its parent automation package. Higher-level
   modules import the leaf directly, while the former owner re-exports the same function objects:

   ```python
   from .git_runtime import (
       clear_repo_caches as clear_repo_caches,
       get_repo_info as get_repo_info,
       get_repo_root as get_repo_root,
       get_repo_slug as get_repo_slug,
       issue_ref as issue_ref,
       pr_ref as pr_ref,
       run as run,
   )
   ```

   Pin both identity and signature compatibility. A wrapper preserves a call shape but changes
   object identity and can break patch paths; an explicit re-export preserves both.

3. **Remove fallback dependencies when the adapter already owns the behavior.** If a transport
   already provides label creation, addition, removal, payload parsing, and readback, route scoped
   and unscoped callers through those primitives. Preserve dry-run behavior and fail closed when
   exclusive-state readback is inconsistent. Test behavior through mocked transport calls rather
   than asserting delegation to a legacy manager.

4. **Make runtime ownership explicit.** Replace imports such as
   `from hephaestus.automation import collaborator` with direct module imports. Keep existing PEP
   562 export maps unchanged for public compatibility, but do not make production modules depend
   on package attribute lookup when they mean a concrete collaborator module.

5. **Build the graph from every Python module, including `__init__.py`.** Derive canonical module
   names from paths, enumerate all package and child modules first, then parse every file. Traverse
   the complete AST so function-local and class-body imports are runtime edges. Exclude only the
   body of runtime-inert `if TYPE_CHECKING:` branches; traverse the `else` branch because it runs.

6. **Resolve imports conservatively.** Resolve absolute and relative `ImportFrom` nodes against the
   importing module/package. For `from package import submodule`, retain the edge to `package` and,
   when `package.submodule` is a discovered module, also retain that child edge. This catches
   child-to-ancestor cycles and package-attribute imports without inventing edges for ordinary
   imported attributes.

7. **Treat lazy exports as executable edges.** Read string module targets from both assigned and
   annotated `_LAZY_EXPORTS` dictionaries. PEP 562 delays an import but does not remove it from the
   runtime graph. Synthetic fixtures must cover both assignment forms so a later annotation change
   cannot silently weaken the guard.

8. **Normalize compatibility façades as components, not allowlisted holes.** When a package
   `__init__.py` intentionally routes implementation-child calls through its package namespace to
   preserve patch seams, map the façade and its implementation children to one component before
   SCC analysis. Ignore only edges internal to that component. Retain every incoming and outgoing
   edge so normalization cannot hide a real cycle through the rest of the package.

9. **Detect strongly connected components and self-loops.** Run Tarjan or Kosaraju over the
   normalized internal graph. Report every component with more than one node and any one-node
   component with an explicit self-edge. A topological sort that merely leaves nodes behind is less
   actionable because it does not identify each cycle component precisely.

10. **Test the graph builder with adversarial synthetic packages.** Use the same builder for the
    real-tree assertion and temporary fixtures for function-local cycles, child-to-ancestor cycles,
    `from package import submodule`, assigned lazy exports, and annotated lazy exports. These tests
    prove the scanner sees the edge classes it claims to enforce; an acyclic real tree alone can pass
    when the scanner is blind.

11. **Ship compatibility and graph enforcement atomically.** Run focused runtime/helper, adapter,
    import-order, graph, and architecture-boundary suites, then lint and type-check every changed
    file. If re-export identity/signatures or unscoped adapter parity fail, restore the original
    import targets and fallback branches together before redesigning the seam. Do not weaken the
    graph builder or add an exception for the failing path.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Trust the issue's "in `__all__`" claim about the deprecated shim | Issue #1545 stated `retry_with_jitter` was exposed via `__all__`; planned the fix from that structural claim | The symbol is actually only in `_LAZY_IMPORTS`, not `__all__`. The fix seam (`__getattr__`) is the same either way, but the implementation differs slightly | Grep the named symbol against the source before trusting an issue's structural claim; don't assume `__all__` and `_LAZY_IMPORTS` always overlap. `verified-local` |
| Assume the access-time warning duplicates the existing call-time warning | Considered "deduping" by relying on the function-body warning alone | Access-time (`hephaestus.X` binding) and call-time (`hephaestus.utils.X(...)`) are DIFFERENT access paths firing for different users; dropping either silently loses coverage | Keep both warnings — they are complementary layers, not duplicates. `verified-local` |
| Write a one-shot warning-assertion test without resetting the cache | `with pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning): _ = hephaestus.retry_with_jitter` | PEP 562 caches the resolved name into module globals on first access; a prior test that touched the symbol means `__getattr__` never re-runs → false-negative / flaky | Call `module.__dict__.pop(name, None)` before asserting, to force a fresh `__getattr__` resolve. `verified-local` |
| Treat the change as purely additive (new test only) | Planned to add a new warning-assertion test and leave existing tests alone | The existing test `test_retry_with_jitter_reachable_from_top_level_lazy_loader` explicitly documented and tolerated the silent lazy resolve; the new behavior contradicts that green test's documented contract | Grep for tests asserting the CURRENT (about-to-change) behavior; REWRITE the stale-tolerant one (don't just append a new test next to it). `verified-local` |
| Change the behavior without touching the prose doc | Planned source + test edits only | `COMPATIBILITY.md` said the warning fires "when called"; a doc-cross-check test or reviewer catches the drift after access-time firing is added | Update the prose deprecation doc that describes the deprecation in the same PR. `verified-local` |
| Assume `stacklevel=2` might be wrong for `__getattr__` indirection | Worried that attribute-lookup indirection might need a different stacklevel than the call-time warning | Not actually wrong — `stacklevel=2` IS correct. Call stack: user access line (frame 1) → `__getattr__` (frame 2) → `warnings.warn`. `stacklevel=2` skips `__getattr__` and correctly attributes the warning to the user's access line. Verified by `access_warnings[0].filename == __file__` assertion passing | `stacklevel=2` is correct for `__getattr__`. The attribute-lookup indirection has the same two-frame depth as a direct one-level helper call. `verified-local` |
| Module-level child→parent import | `from hephaestus.logging.utils import get_current_correlation_id` at top of `helpers.py` | `CircularImportError`/`ImportError` at startup because `logging.utils` already imports `utils.helpers` | Any child-to-parent import at module level creates a cycle if the parent imports the child; use a function-local import |
| Thread correlation ID as a parameter | `run_subprocess(cmd, cid=None)` plumbed through the call chain | Intermediate functions must accept a param they never use; refactor becomes painful | Reserve parameters for true call-level args; use ambient context (contextvars) for ambient state |
| Move the helper function to dodge the edge | Relocate `get_current_correlation_id()` into `utils` | Creates a god-module, couples `utils.helpers` to logging concerns, violates SRP | Move the import, not the function — keep it where it semantically belongs |
| Eager-load new phase modules in `__init__.py` | `from .address_reviewer import AddressReviewer` directly | Defeats lazy loading, increases import time, breaks the established pattern | Use `_LAZY_EXPORTS` + `__getattr__` and add the module to `_PHASE_ENTRYPOINTS` |
| Create a parallel surface test file | New `test_package_surface.py` to pin `__all__` | DRY violation — existing `test_package_imports.py` already iterates `__all__` | Extend existing test coverage; don't duplicate iteration logic |
| Pin the surface with strict equality | `assert set(automation.__all__) == {hardcoded literal}` authored on the feature branch | `AuditReviewer` landed on `main` via independent PR #1067 while the branch was open; CI failed on ALL Py legs with `Extra items in the left set: 'AuditReviewer'`. The source `__all__` was correct; the test literal went stale (branch-divergence / merge-skew) | A strict-equality pin breaks every open branch the instant a peer lands elsewhere. Prefer a subset assertion (`expected - set(__all__)`) that catches removals but tolerates parallel additions; if you keep equality, re-sync the literal on rebase |
| "Fix" the stale pin by editing the source | Considered removing `AuditReviewer` from `__all__` to satisfy the failing equality assertion | Would have silently shrunk the public SDK surface — `AuditReviewer` is a legitimate peer export added by #1067 | Decide test-vs-source BEFORE editing: `git log -p -1 -- __init__.py` proved the symbol was a real, separately-landed export. Fix the stale TEST literal, never the correct source |
| Trust the local suite over the CI log | Saw 3 local failures and assumed all 3 were caused by my change | 2 were live-session environment noise: `HEPH_*_MODEL` env vars set in the session, and live `gh` auth leaking real PR data past a mock. Only 1 (`test_public_surface_pins_expected_symbols`) was the genuine CI failure | When local shows MORE failures than CI, verify each against the CI log. `env -i HOME=$HOME PATH=$PATH pytest` isolates env-var leakage; `git stash` isolates pre-existing failures; `gh run view --log \| grep <test>` is the decisive tiebreaker (those 2 PASSED in CI) |
| Re-run CI on a "CI failing" lazy-export PR with no failing test | Assumed a flaky/red check and triggered `gh run rerun` | The blocker was a merge conflict (`mergeStateStatus=DIRTY`), not a test; logs showed only runner setup | When a PR reads CI-failing but no test failed, check `gh pr view <N> --json mergeStateStatus` FIRST — `DIRTY` means rebase, not re-run |
| Treat the duplicated `_LAZY_EXPORTS` entry as a real merge of two different lines | Tried to keep both sides of the add/add conflict | Both branches added the *identical* export (sibling PR #968 landed it first); keeping both yields a duplicate key | Keep ONE copy; verify with `git show origin/main:<__init__> \| grep <symbol>` |
| Reorder `_LAZY_EXPORTS`/`__all__` keys to "match main" during the conflict | Fought over dict key ordering to make tests pass | Surface tests use `set()` equality / `<=` subset, so order never affected pass/fail — wasted effort | Order-insensitive surface tests mean you only need set-membership correct, not key order |
| Commit the resolved rebase without re-running pre-commit | Assumed code clean on the old base stays clean post-rebase | `ruff-format` reflowed a multi-line f-string assertion onto one line on the new base → pre-commit failed | Always re-run `pre-commit run --all-files` after a rebase; ruff-format is base-sensitive |
| `git push` the rebased branch normally | Plain push after a history-rewriting rebase | Non-fast-forward rejection (rebase rewrote history) | Push rebased branches with `--force-with-lease` |
| Bare `import tomllib` assuming 3.11+ matrix | Used stdlib `tomllib` directly | Matrix also ran 3.10; collection failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tomllib'` | Always check the lowest Python in the matrix before using newer stdlib modules |
| `try/except ImportError` instead of version guard | `try: import tomllib except ImportError: import tomli as tomllib` | Works at runtime but mypy cannot statically narrow the type; false positive on 3.11+ | Use `sys.version_info >= (3, 11)` — mypy treats it as a narrowing predicate |
| Skip declaring the backport dependency | Did not add `tomli; python_version < '3.11'` | `tomli` absent in fresh CI env → `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tomli'` | Declare backports as conditional deps in both `pyproject.toml` and `pixi.toml` |
| Leave POSIX-only imports bare on Windows | `import curses`/`import fcntl` at top level, let CI surface it | `ModuleNotFoundError` broke the whole subpackage at import time, cascading into unrelated-looking entry-point/integrity checks | stdlib ≠ always available; POSIX-only stdlib needs the same guard as any optional dep |
| Enable full OS matrix after only fixing imports | `[ubuntu, macos, windows]` after curses/fcntl/tzdata fixes | Windows still failed on file-mode bits, path encoding, POSIX-only signal/coredump tests | Runtime import guards don't fix tests that encode POSIX assumptions; full port is multi-session |
| Inline per-test Windows skips | Ad-hoc `if sys.platform == "win32"` branches in each failing test | Death-by-a-thousand-cuts; sprawling diff, obscured scope | Track cross-OS port as a dedicated issue; revert matrix to ubuntu-only; keep the import guards |
| Guessed the COMPATIBILITY.md "Added" version from the latest git tag | Stamped the stable-symbol table "Added" column `0.9.8` purely because `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` returned `v0.9.7` | The next release may be `0.9.8`, `0.10.0`, or `1.0.0` depending on cadence/roadmap; a guessed number silently mis-documents the stability contract | Resolve the target version from `docs/RELEASING.md` / open milestones / roadmap, or flag it explicitly for the reviewer to confirm — never infer it from the latest tag. `unverified` (plan for ProjectHephaestus #1513) |
| Grepped only the obvious test file for `__all__` pins | Planned to add the surface-pin test to `tests/unit/logging/test_utils.py` and assumed no other pin existed | A strict-equality surface pin (`set(pkg.__all__) == literal`) can live in a DIFFERENT test file and breaks the moment you widen `__all__`; the plan would miss it | Grep the WHOLE test tree for package name + `__all__` + surface/pin/expected (`grep -rn "logging" tests/ \| grep -iE "__all__\|surface\|pin\|expected"`) before widening — a widening change has a non-local test blast radius. `unverified` (plan for ProjectHephaestus #1513) |
| Took the audit finding's "Stable subpackage" premise as given | Built the whole "promote to stable surface" fix on "`hephaestus.logging` is Stable (COMPATIBILITY.md:56)" without re-reading the tier source | An audit finding's premise is itself a claim; if the tier were actually Experimental/Deprecated the entire framing would be wrong (team KB: 3/29 strict-audit findings were factually wrong) | Verify the stability-tier premise on disk before building the fix around it: `grep -n "logging" COMPATIBILITY.md \| grep -iE "stable\|tier"`. `unverified` (plan for ProjectHephaestus #1513) |
| Assumed any re-export binding satisfies submodule patch paths | Re-exported the symbols from `__init__.py` without asserting they are the SAME object as the submodule's | Existing tests that `mock.patch("hephaestus.logging.utils.X")` rely on identity; a divergent package-root binding makes one patch path silently ineffective | Assert re-export identity (`pkg.X is utils.X`) and grep for existing `patch("hephaestus.logging.utils...")` usages to confirm none depend on a divergent binding. `unverified` (plan for ProjectHephaestus #1513) |
| Treated an `__init__.py` re-export widening as boundary-risk-free | Reasoned the eager re-exports were safe because `utils.py` only pulls stdlib + `hephaestus.constants` + formatters, and skipped the surface/boundary tests | That reasoning is a hypothesis until the enforced tests run; any `__init__.py` import addition can regress `test_import_surface.py` / `test_automation_boundary.py` | Always include `test_import_surface.py` and `test_automation_boundary.py` in the verification set when touching a package `__init__.py`, even for a "pure re-export". `unverified` (plan for ProjectHephaestus #1513) |
| Fixed only the 2 symbols named in the issue | Issue #1511 named `add_dry_run_arg` + `DRY_RUN_HELP_CAVEAT`; considered fixing just those two | `add_github_throttle_args` + `configure_github_throttle_from_args` had the identical defect — fixing only the named symbols would re-trigger the same `[S14 API Design]` audit finding for the skipped ones | When an audit finding names a subset of a defect class, fix the WHOLE defect class in one PR (check `set(submodule.__all__) - set(pkg.__all__)` to enumerate all missing symbols, not just the named ones). `verified-local` (ProjectHephaestus #1511) |
| Considered using `_LAZY_EXPORTS` for a stdlib-only module | `cli/utils.py` pulls only `argparse`, `json`, `math`, `sys` + `hephaestus._version_lookup`; still reached for the lazy export pattern | Lazy export infrastructure is only justified when the submodule has heavyweight or boundary-crossing imports (e.g. `pydantic`, `curses`, `hephaestus.automation.*`). For a stdlib-only module, eager `from … import (…)` in `__init__.py` is simpler, faster, and avoids indirection | Use eager re-export when the source module is stdlib-only; reserve `_LAZY_EXPORTS`/`__getattr__` for modules that must stay unloaded at package import time. `verified-local` (ProjectHephaestus #1511) |
| Used a strict-equality pin for the surface test | Considered `assert set(cli.__all__) == set(utils.__all__)` | A strict-equality pin breaks every open branch the moment any sibling PR adds a new symbol to either module | Use a subset assertion (`set(utils.__all__) - set(cli.__all__)`) — it catches regressions (symbols removed from `cli.__all__` that remain in `utils.__all__`) without blocking parallel additions. `verified-local` (ProjectHephaestus #1511) |

It only failed reliably when the WHOLE module / broad `tests/unit/validation` suite ran with the change applied | For live-tree-scanning validation tests, NEVER trust an isolated run.

tests/unit/automation/test_package_imports.py::test_public_surface_pins_expected_symbols PASSED
======================== 9 passed in 0.45s ========================
```

`__all__`, `_LAZY_EXPORTS` keys, and `TYPE_CHECKING` imports must all be alphabetically sorted (case-sensitive, uppercase first). `_PHASE_ENTRYPOINTS` order does not matter (membership check only).

### Stale surface-pin — failure signature, diagnosis, and fix

CI failure signature (every Python leg, exactly one failing test):

```text
FAILED tests/unit/automation/test_package_imports.py::test_public_surface_pins_expected_symbols
    assert set(automation.__all__) == expected
E   Extra items in the left set:
E     'AuditReviewer'
```

Diagnose test-vs-source, then fix the test (not the source):

```bash
# 1. Confirm OPEN + which checks fail
gh pr view 968 --json state,statusCheckRollup

# 2. Find the single failing test among thousands
gh run view --job <job-id> --log-failed | grep -iE "FAILED|AssertionError"

# 3. Reproduce locally — the set-diff names the exact symbol
pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit/automation/test_package_imports.py::test_public_surface_pins_expected_symbols -v

# 4. PROVE the symbol is a legitimate, separately-landed export (decides test-vs-source)
git log --oneline -- hephaestus/automation/__init__.py   # AuditReviewer entered via PR #1067 on main
git log -p -1 -- hephaestus/automation/__init__.py        # "feat(automation): add audit reviewer..."
```

The fix is one line in the TEST, alphabetically placed, with zero source change:

```python
expected = {
    "AddressReviewer",
    "AuditReviewer",   # ← added: legitimate peer that landed on main via #1067
    "CIDriver",
    # ...
}
```

Separating the real CI failure from live-session environment noise (3 local failures, only 1 genuine):

```bash
# env-var leak (HEPH_PLANNER_MODEL / HEPH_IMPLEMENTER_MODEL / HEPH_REVIEWER_MODEL set in the live session)
env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="$PATH" pixi run pytest \
    tests/unit/automation/test_loop_runner.py::test_phase_env_model_vars_only_when_non_empty -q   # PASS ⇒ environmental

# pre-existing vs your-change (live gh auth leaked 24/40 real PRs past the mock)
git stash && pixi run pytest tests/unit/automation/test_ci_driver_prs_mode.py -q ; git stash pop  # same fail ⇒ not yours

# decisive tiebreaker: all 3 noise tests PASSED in CI (no live gh auth, no HEPH_*_MODEL there)
gh run view --job <job-id> --log | grep -E "test_phase_env_model_vars_only_when_non_empty|test_ci_driver_prs_mode"
```

### Version-gated guard — expected output & type-ignore

```text
$ pixi run pytest tests/unit -q --tb=no
2590 passed, 2 skipped in 168.87s
```

Collection must succeed on both 3.10 and 3.11+ legs. On 3.11+ mypy knows the `else` is unreachable, so suppress with both codes:

```python
if sys.version_info >= (3, 11):
    import tomllib
else:
    import tomli as tomllib  # type: ignore[no-redef, unused-ignore]
```

### POSIX-only guard — verified-passing pattern

```python
try:
    import fcntl
except ModuleNotFoundError:  # Windows: fcntl is POSIX-only
    fcntl = None  # type: ignore[assignment]

def _acquire_lock(fp) -> None:
    if fcntl is not None:
        fcntl.flock(fp.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
    # cross-process locking is best-effort no-op on Windows

def _release_lock(fp) -> None:
    if fcntl is not None:
        fcntl.flock(fp.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN)
```

```python
# tests/integration/test_entry_points.py
POSIX_ONLY_SUBPACKAGES = ("automation",)

def test_entry_point_importable(module_path: str) -> None:
    if sys.platform == "win32" and any(p in module_path for p in POSIX_ONLY_SUBPACKAGES):
        pytest.skip("automation CLIs require POSIX stdlib (curses/fcntl)")
    importlib.import_module(module_path)
```

### Access-time DeprecationWarning across the lazy-loader seam — verified pattern (verified-local)

Executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus issue #1545. All tests listed below passed.

```python
# hephaestus/__init__.py — _DEPRECATED_LAZY dict + modified __getattr__
# retry_with_jitter lives in _LAZY_IMPORTS (NOT __all__ — the issue misnamed this).

_DEPRECATED_LAZY: dict[str, str] = {
    "retry_with_jitter": (
        "hephaestus.retry_with_jitter is deprecated; use "
        "retry_with_backoff(jitter=True, max_delay=...) instead. "
        "It will be removed no earlier than the next major version after 1.0."
    ),
}

def __getattr__(name: str) -> Any:
    """Lazy-load public symbols on first access (PEP 562)."""
    if name in _LAZY_IMPORTS:
        if name in _DEPRECATED_LAZY:
            import warnings
            warnings.warn(_DEPRECATED_LAZY[name], DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        module_name, attr = _LAZY_IMPORTS[name]
        import importlib
        module = importlib.import_module(module_name)
        value = getattr(module, attr)
        globals()[name] = value
        return value
    raise AttributeError(f"module 'hephaestus' has no attribute {name!r}")
```

```python
# Regression test — replaces stale-tolerant test_retry_with_jitter_reachable_from_top_level_lazy_loader
def test_retry_with_jitter_access_emits_deprecation_warning(self) -> None:
    import hephaestus

    # Bust PEP 562 cache — force __getattr__ to re-run
    hephaestus.__dict__.pop("retry_with_jitter", None)

    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as caught:
        warnings.simplefilter("always")
        symbol = hephaestus.retry_with_jitter  # ACCESS only, do not call

    assert callable(symbol)
    access_warnings = [w for w in caught if issubclass(w.category, DeprecationWarning)]
    assert access_warnings, "Accessing hephaestus.retry_with_jitter must emit DeprecationWarning"
    assert "retry_with_jitter" in str(access_warnings[0].message)
    # stacklevel=2 must attribute the warning to the caller's file
    assert access_warnings[0].filename == __file__, (
        f"DeprecationWarning should be attributed to the caller's file "
        f"({__file__}); got {access_warnings[0].filename}. Check stacklevel."
    )
```

Tests that passed:

```text
tests/unit/utils/test_deprecation_warnings.py — 3 passed
tests/unit/utils/test_retry.py -k jitter — 7 passed
tests/unit/validation/test_import_surface.py — passed
tests/unit/validation/test_automation_boundary.py — passed
ruff check hephaestus/__init__.py tests/unit/utils/test_deprecation_warnings.py — all checks passed
ruff format --check — 2 files already formatted
mypy — clean
```

Key confirmed values: `stacklevel=2` inside `__getattr__` correctly points at the user's access line
(confirmed by `access_warnings[0].filename == __file__` assertion passing). `import warnings` deferred
inside the `if name in _DEPRECATED_LAZY:` block does not breach `test_automation_boundary.py`.

### Per-symbol COMPATIBILITY.md API-table alignment — failure signature & full-suite-only reproduction (verified-local)

Executed end-to-end for ProjectHephaestus issue #1419. Failure signature when `configure_cli_logging` is in `__all__` but absent from the table:

```text
[missing-from-docs] hephaestus.cli.configure_cli_logging is in __all__ but has no row in COMPATIBILITY.md
FAILED tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py::TestLiveTreeAlignment::test_real_compatibility_md_is_aligned
FAILED tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py::TestMain::test_main_returns_zero_on_real_repo
```

The fix is one alphabetical row, version read from same-cycle siblings (zero source change to the test):

```markdown
| `add_version_arg` | 0.1.0 | Add a `--version` flag to a parser |
| `configure_cli_logging` | 0.9.8 | Configure standard stderr-safe logging for a CLI |
| `configure_github_throttle_from_args` | 0.9.0 | Apply parsed throttle args to the GitHub client |
```

Full-suite-only reproduction (the dangerous part — isolated runs are false negatives):

```bash
# FALSE NEGATIVE — passes in isolation even with the missing-row bug present:
pixi run python -m pytest \
    "tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py::TestLiveTreeAlignment::test_real_compatibility_md_is_aligned" -q --no-cov

# AUTHORITATIVE — fails on the missing row; this is what you must run before claiming green:
pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py -q --no-cov
```

Tests that passed after the doc-row fix: `tests/unit/cli/test_utils.py`, `tests/unit/automation/test_ensure_state_labels.py`,
`tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py` (full `tests/unit/validation` + others: 3186 passed). `ruff` clean;
`pixi run mypy` = "Success: no issues found in 446 source files"; `markdownlint-cli2 COMPATIBILITY.md` passed.
Verified locally; CI confirmation pending on the originating PR.

### Compatibility-retirement decision matrix (unverified v1.9.0 guidance)

| Situation | Import policy | Companion check |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Module is newer than the lowest supported Python | Version-gated stdlib/backport guard | Exercise the lowest CI leg and declare the conditional backport dependency |
| Module is guaranteed by the enforced Python floor and no shared resolver exists | Direct stdlib import | Assert obsolete backport names are absent |
| Module is guaranteed by the floor but a canonical resolver already owns policy | Use the resolver from every consumer | Inject a fake resolver result and use invalid source to prove the seam |
| Stdlib module needs external platform data (`zoneinfo` on Windows) | Direct stdlib import plus platform data dependency | Keep `tzdata`; test representative timezone construction |
| Third-party dependency is optional at runtime | Lazy shared capability resolver with actionable exception translation | Mask the module in `sys.modules`; assert the public error and chained import cause |

Planned ProjectHephaestus acceptance checks included a repository-wide `tomllib` inventory,
resolver-seam unit tests for both remaining production bypasses, a source assertion excluding
`backports.zoneinfo`, and the existing rate-limit tests. These checks were supplied as a plan
only and remain unverified.

### Whole-package import graph parameters (unverified v1.10.0 guidance)

| Parameter | Required behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Source population | Every `**/*.py`, including package initializers |
| Runtime import traversal | Full AST; skip only `TYPE_CHECKING` bodies |
| Relative imports | Resolve from the importing module/package |
| `from package import submodule` | Keep package edge plus resolvable child edge |
| Lazy exports | Read string targets from assigned and annotated `_LAZY_EXPORTS` dictionaries |
| Compatibility façade | Normalize façade plus implementation children as one component |
| Cycle detector | SCCs of size >1 plus explicit self-loops |
| Regression fixtures | Local, ancestor, child-submodule, assigned-lazy, annotated-lazy cycles |
| Compatibility pin | Re-export object identity and `inspect.signature` equality |
| Import smoke | Fresh subprocesses in both historical import orders |

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ProjectHephaestus | Shared TOML/PyYAML capability-resolution and Python 3.13 floor cleanup plan | **PLAN ONLY / unverified** (section I). Proposed: route the final production `tomllib` consumers through `import_tomllib()`, remove the obsolete `backports.zoneinfo` branch in favor of direct stdlib `ZoneInfo`, preserve Windows `tzdata`, and add invalid-input resolver-seam tests. No implementation, local test run, or CI evidence was observed. |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #2363 — eliminate automation import cycles with neutral Git runtime helpers and an AST SCC guard | **PLAN ONLY / unverified** (section J). The reviewed plan preserves the already-landed removal of the historical `_review_phase.py` edge, extracts subprocess/repository identity below `git_utils` and `pr_manager`, removes legacy adapter label fallbacks, makes package-attribute imports explicit, and proposes real-tree plus synthetic SCC regressions. No implementation, local test run, or CI evidence was observed. |
| ProjectHephaestus | PR #633 — correlation_id propagation | Function-local import of `get_current_correlation_id` in `hephaestus/utils/helpers.py:170-172`; lint passes with no `noqa` |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #799 / PR #988 — lazy-export add/add rebase conflict | Branch `799-auto-impl` widened `_LAZY_EXPORTS`/`__all__` in `hephaestus/automation/__init__.py`; main had already added the same `"PRReviewer"` entry via #968/#775 → PR read CI-failing but `mergeStateStatus=DIRTY` was the real blocker. Rebased onto origin/main (only `__init__.py` conflicted; `test_package_imports.py` rebased clean), kept ONE `"PRReviewer"` copy, set()-based surface tests ignored key order. Full suite 4136 passed / 19 skipped; pre-commit reflowed one f-string line; GPG-signed. **verified-local** |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #775 / PR #968 — widen automation SDK surface | Exposed PlanReviewer, AddressReviewer, CIDriver (+Options) via `__all__`/`_LAZY_EXPORTS`/`_PHASE_ENTRYPOINTS`; surface-pinning test; 1081 automation tests pass |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #775 / PR #968 vs #1067 — stale surface-pin repair | `test_public_surface_pins_expected_symbols` failed on every Py leg with `Extra items in the left set: 'AuditReviewer'`; `AuditReviewer` was a legitimate peer added on `main` by independent PR #1067. Fixed the stale test literal (one-line add, alphabetised), zero source change. `verified-local` — CI re-run confirmation pending. 2 sibling local failures (`HEPH_*_MODEL` env leak; live `gh` auth past a mock) proven environmental via `env -i` + `git stash` + grep-the-CI-log |
| ProjectHephaestus | PR #657 — fix broken main CI | `sys.version_info` guard for `tomllib`/`tomli` in `tests/unit/ci/test_bandit_config.py`; conditional deps in `pyproject.toml`/`pixi.toml`; 2590 tests pass |
| ProjectHephaestus | PRs #534, #536, #538 (issue #539 tracks full port) — Windows-importability | curses guard in `CursesUI`, fcntl guard in `planner.py`, `tzdata` for `hephaestus.github.rate_limit` |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1545 — access-time DeprecationWarning for `retry_with_jitter` | Executed end-to-end: added `_DEPRECATED_LAZY` dict + modified `__getattr__` in `hephaestus/__init__.py`; replaced stale-tolerant `test_retry_with_jitter_reachable_from_top_level_lazy_loader` with `test_retry_with_jitter_access_emits_deprecation_warning` (including `__dict__.pop` cache-bust and `stacklevel=2` filename assertion); updated `COMPATIBILITY.md` bullet. Symbol is in `_LAZY_IMPORTS`, not `__all__` (issue misnamed it). All tests passed: 3 in `test_deprecation_warnings.py`, 7 in `test_retry.py -k jitter`, `test_import_surface.py`, `test_automation_boundary.py`. Ruff + mypy clean. **verified-local** — CI pending after PR merges |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1511 — `[S14 API Design]` align `hephaestus/cli/__init__.py __all__` with `cli/utils.py __all__` | **verified-local** (section G). Added 4 missing symbols (`DRY_RUN_HELP_CAVEAT`, `add_dry_run_arg`, `add_github_throttle_args`, `configure_github_throttle_from_args`) to both the import block and `__all__` in `hephaestus/cli/__init__.py`. Eager re-export (`cli/utils.py` is stdlib-only). No COMPATIBILITY.md change (no per-symbol table for `hephaestus.cli`). Added `test_cli_all_covers_module_all` (subset assertion) + `test_dry_run_symbols_reexport_identity` (identity check) in `tests/unit/cli/test_utils.py`. All 79 tests in `tests/unit/cli/` passed; `test_import_surface.py` + `test_automation_boundary.py` passed; mypy clean (423 source files); ruff clean. CI pending after PR merges |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1419 — share validation CLI parser + centralize CLI logging; per-symbol COMPATIBILITY.md API-table alignment + full-suite-only live-tree-scan hazard | **verified-local** (section G′). Added `configure_cli_logging` to `hephaestus/cli/utils.py:__all__` and re-exported it in `hephaestus/cli/__init__.py:__all__`; the live-tree `test_api_table_docs.py` (`TestLiveTreeAlignment::test_real_compatibility_md_is_aligned` / `TestMain::test_main_returns_zero_on_real_repo`) failed with `[missing-from-docs] hephaestus.cli.configure_cli_logging is in __all__ but has no row in COMPATIBILITY.md`. Fix = one alphabetical row in `### hephaestus.cli` (`\| configure_cli_logging \| 0.9.8 \| …`), version read from same-cycle siblings (`create_validation_parser`/`resolve_repo_root` = 0.9.8; latest tag was `v0.9.7`). KEY HAZARD: the test PASSED in ISOLATION (and on a stashed/clean tree) with the bug present — a false negative — and failed only when the WHOLE module / broad `tests/unit/validation` suite ran. Authoritative check = `pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit/validation/test_api_table_docs.py -q --no-cov`. All affected tests pass: `tests/unit/cli/test_utils.py`, `tests/unit/automation/test_ensure_state_labels.py`, `test_api_table_docs.py` (3186 passed); ruff clean; mypy "Success: no issues found in 446 source files"; markdownlint clean. UPGRADES the issue #1513 COMPATIBILITY.md version-stamping guidance from `unverified` → `verified-local` (version resolved from same-cycle siblings, confirmed on disk). Secondary cross-link: the issue body/plan predated sibling PR #1637 (which merged a WIDER `create_validation_parser` API the plan said to narrow) → do NOT reverse merged code; implement only the genuinely-unimplemented slice (reinforces `dry-refactoring-workflow`). Verified locally; CI confirmation pending on the originating PR |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1513 — `[S14 API Design]` promote correlation-ID functions to the stable surface | **PLAN ONLY / unverified** (COMPATIBILITY.md version-stamping in section G). Plan re-exports `set_correlation_id` / `get_current_correlation_id` / `correlation_id_scope` from `hephaestus/logging/__init__.py`, adds them to `__all__`, documents them in the `COMPATIBILITY.md` stable-symbol table (stamped `0.9.8` purely because latest tag is `v0.9.7` — flagged as an UNVERIFIED guess that the reviewer must confirm against roadmap), and adds a subset-assertion surface-pin test. Five planning traps captured: version-stamp must be verified not guessed; grep the WHOLE test tree for a non-local strict-equality `__all__` pin before widening; verify the "Stable subpackage" premise on disk; assert re-export identity for `patch("hephaestus.logging.utils...")` paths; include `test_import_surface.py`/`test_automation_boundary.py` for the `__init__.py` widening. Not executed in CI. **Update (issue #1419):** the "version-stamp must be verified not guessed" trap is now RESOLVED `verified-local` — the resolution rule is to read the "since" version off SAME-CYCLE SIBLINGS already in the table (not tag arithmetic); see the issue #1419 row above and section G′ |
| ProjectHephaestus | Issue #1512 — `[S14 API Design]` add companion `__dir__()` to the PEP 562 lazy-loader package | **PLAN ONLY / unverified** (section H). Plan adds a module-level `__dir__()` returning `sorted(set(_LAZY_IMPORTS) \| set(__all__) \| set(globals()))` to `hephaestus/__init__.py` (which already defines `__getattr__` for lazy loading but no `__dir__`, so `dir(hephaestus)` shows only ~4 eager names) and pins it with a `TestDirDiscoverability` class in the existing `tests/integration/test_package_import.py`. Durable lessons captured: a custom `__dir__` REPLACES (does not merge) the default listing, so `set(globals())` MUST be folded in or `dir()` SHRINKS; `__dir__` returns names only (no attribute access) so a deprecated lazy shim is listed without firing its `DeprecationWarning`; pin by SUBSET invariant not a hardcoded count (the audit's "35 symbols" was already stale at 40 `_LAZY_IMPORTS` on disk); regression-test that `dir()` does not shrink the visible set; extend the existing surface test file, not a parallel one. Not executed in CI |
