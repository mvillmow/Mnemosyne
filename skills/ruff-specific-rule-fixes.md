# Ruff Specific Rule Fixes

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-13 |
| **Objective** | Fix specific Ruff rule violations (S101 assert-in-production, C901 cyclomatic complexity, RUF022 `__all__`-sort, I001 import-sort) and recognize when repeated policy violations mean the linter itself is the root cause |
| **Outcome** | Verified — S101 guards converted across 20+ sites (PRs #1142, #1211), C901 extractions verified (PRs #1546, #1050), wrong-direction linter root-cause pattern verified-CI (PRs #863/#865/#866/#867) |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |

## When to Use

- Ruff reports **S101** (`use of assert`) in production code — `assert x is not None  # noqa: S101` precondition guards that must always run (Python's `-O` flag disables `assert`).
- Ruff or a custom hook reports **C901** (`<function> is too complex (N > 10)`) — adding conditional blocks pushed a function over the cyclomatic-complexity limit.
- Ruff reports **RUF022** (`__all__` is not sorted) or **I001** (import block is un-sorted) — both are marked `[*]` fixable by ruff itself.
- The **same policy violation** appears in 2+ independent files/configs — the linter that should enforce the policy is absent, misconfigured, or wrong-direction.
- You are deciding between a `# noqa` suppression, fixing the violation, or promoting the rule to error-level enforcement.
- You are tempted to open N parallel PRs to fix N violating files — pause and check the linter first.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# S101 — find assert guards in production code (exclude tests)
grep -rn "noqa: S101\|assert.*is not None" <src-path>/

# C901 — locally reproduce the complexity check
pre-commit run --all-files            # ruff C901 + custom CC hook

# RUF022 (__all__ not sorted) / I001 (import block un-sorted) — both [*]-fixable
# NEVER manually reorder: isort sorts by the 'as' alias name, not the original symbol
pixi run ruff check --fix <file1> <file2>
# Running --fix on just the affected files is safe and idempotent.
# Three errors were fixed in one pass across two files (issue #1189).

# Linter-as-root-cause — count distinct files violating the SAME rule
audit_output | grep "Rule: <rule-id>" | awk '{print $2}' | sort -u | wc -l
# >= 2 distinct files  ->  fix the LINTER first, not each file
```

```python
# S101: assert guard  ->  explicit RuntimeError
# BEFORE
assert self.experiment_dir is not None  # noqa: S101
return self.experiment_dir / "checkpoint.json"
# AFTER
if self.experiment_dir is None:
    raise RuntimeError("experiment_dir must be set before getting checkpoint path")
return self.experiment_dir / "checkpoint.json"
```

```python
# C901: inline branches  ->  extract helpers (each gets its own CC budget)
def _restore_run_context(ctx, state):
    if condition:
        _restore_judgment(ctx)        # CC counted in helper, not parent
    if condition:
        _restore_run_result(ctx)

def _restore_judgment(ctx): ...       # starts at CC=1
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Pattern A — Fix Ruff S101 (assert -> RuntimeError)

**Key insight**: `assert` is inappropriate in production code because Python's `-O` (optimize)
flag disables all `assert` statements. Legitimate runtime guards must use explicit `raise`.

1. **Find all violations** (current line numbers, not the stale ones in the issue):

   ```bash
   grep -rn "noqa: S101" <src-path>/          # production only
   grep -rn "noqa: S101" <src-path>/ <test-path>/   # full picture; tests may legitimately keep noqa
   ```

   The grep often finds MORE asserts than the issue lists (10 vs 6 reported in `runner.py`) — fix all of them if the deliverable is "no S101 in file X".

2. **Read context around each assert** to write a message describing *what operation is blocked*, not just restating the condition. Message format: `"<attribute> must be set before <operation>"`.

3. **Classify and replace**:

   | Assert pattern | Replacement |
   | --------------- | ----------- |
   | `assert x is not None  # noqa: S101` | `if x is None: raise RuntimeError("x must be set before <op>")` |
   | `assert x is not None, "msg"  # noqa: S101` | `if x is None: raise RuntimeError("msg")` (reuse the message verbatim) |
   | `assert condition  # noqa: S101` | `if not condition: raise RuntimeError("<condition description>")` |

   **For-else defensive guard** (e.g. retry loop in `llm_judge.py`): the `else` fires only if every attempt caught a `ValueError`, so `last_parse_error` is logically never `None`. Keep the guard — protect against future breakage — do not delete it:

   ```python
   else:
       if last_parse_error is None:
           raise RuntimeError("Judge retry loop exhausted but last_parse_error is None")
       raise last_parse_error
   ```

4. **Add regression tests** to the existing test class (no new files unless a guard has no home):

   ```python
   def test_method_raises_if_x_none(self, tmp_path: Path) -> None:
       obj = MyClass(attr=None, ...)
       with pytest.raises(RuntimeError, match="attr must be set before"):
           obj.method()
   ```

   For logically-unreachable guards (the for-else case), test the *observable adjacent behavior* — that the normal exhausted-retry path re-raises `ValueError` (not `RuntimeError`) — rather than contriving a path into the guard:

   ```python
   def test_raises_value_error_not_runtime_error_when_parse_fails(self, tmp_path: Path) -> None:
       bad = "Not valid JSON at all"
       with pytest.raises(ValueError):
           self._run_with_call_side_effects(tmp_path, [(bad, "", bad)] * 3)
   ```

   Coverage may stay flat — guard paths protect against impossible states and aren't exercised. That is expected.

5. **Verify and commit**:

   ```bash
   grep -rn "noqa: S101" <src-path>/    # must be empty
   pre-commit run --all-files           # run TWICE: ruff-format reflows long raise lines on pass 1
   pixi run python -m pytest <test-path>/ -q
   ```

#### Pattern B — Fix Ruff C901 (extract helpers)

1. **Identify the violation**: CI shows the function name and CC score, e.g. `_restore_run_context is too complex (11 > 10)`.

2. **Count branches**: each `if`/`elif`/`else`/`for`/`while`/`except`/`and`/`or` adds +1. The function starts at CC=1.

   | CC | Status | Action |
   | -- | ------ | ------ |
   | 1-7 | Safe | Can add 1-3 branches freely |
   | 8-9 | Warning | One more `if/else` hits the limit |
   | 10 | At limit | Any new branch fails CI |
   | 11+ | CI failure | Must extract helpers |

3. **Extract self-contained blocks** into module-level helpers or instance methods — blocks with their own imports, operating on a clear parameter subset, not sharing mutable state beyond `ctx`/`self`. Each helper gets its own CC budget starting at 1. Keep guard clauses in the parent:

   ```python
   if is_at_or_past_state(run_state, RunState.JUDGE_COMPLETE) and ctx.judgment is None:
       _restore_judgment(ctx)

   def _restore_judgment(ctx: Any) -> None:
       """Restore ctx.judgment from on-disk judge result."""
       from scylla.e2e.judge_runner import _has_valid_judge_result, _load_judge_result
       judge_dir = get_judge_dir(ctx.run_dir)
       if _has_valid_judge_result(ctx.run_dir):
           ctx.judgment = _load_judge_result(judge_dir)
   ```

4. **Multi-pass rendering — return-value threading**: when a method runs several sequential passes that each compute state feeding the next (workers -> separator -> logs), extract each pass as an instance method that takes and returns the running offset. No shared mutable state:

   ```python
   def _refresh_display(self, screen, height, width):
       start_row = 0
       start_row = self._draw_workers(start_row, height, width)
       start_row = self._draw_separator(start_row, height, width)
       start_row = self._draw_logs(start_row, height, width)

   def _draw_workers(self, start_row: int, height: int, width: int) -> int:
       ...
       return next_row   # next free row, threaded into the following pass
   ```

   Test each helper for return-value threading, boundary handling, and truncation independently.

5. **Verify**:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files                     # ruff C901 + custom "Check Cyclomatic Complexity" hook
   pixi run python -m pytest <test-path>/ -x -q
   ```

   Do NOT use `# noqa: C901` to suppress — extract-method is the correct fix. Many repos prohibit `--no-verify` and lint suppression.

#### Pattern C — Linter as root cause of repeated policy violations

When an audit flags the SAME rule violated in **2+ independent files**, the file count (not line
count) is the signal: two violations in one file are a localized bug; two in unrelated files are a
systemic one. The linter/validator that should enforce the policy is the FIRST suspect.

1. **Tally findings by rule ID**:

   ```bash
   jq -r '.findings[].rule' audit.json | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn   # JSON
   grep -oP 'Rule:\s*\K\S+' audit.md | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn      # text
   ```

2. **Locate the linter's rule definition** (read BOTH the good-pattern and bad-pattern sides):

   ```bash
   grep -rn "<rule-keyword>" <validation-module-path>/ <validation-tests-path>/ scripts/audit_*.py
   ```

3. **Locate the META source** the rule claims to enforce — `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, branch-protection rules. Read its statement verbatim.

4. **Diff linter assertion vs META source**:

   | Linter says | META says | Verdict |
   | ----------- | --------- | ------- |
   | Accept X, reject Y | Require X, prohibit Y | Linter correct — violations are real bugs; fix per-file |
   | Accept Y, reject X | Require X, prohibit Y | **Linter is WRONG-DIRECTION — fix linter FIRST** |
   | No assertion | Require X, prohibit Y | Linter has a gap — add the assertion, then fix files |

   If wrong-direction, the dependent files were written to COMPLY WITH the wrong linter — they are downstream consumers of a wrong contract, not independently buggy.

5. **Re-sequence PRs**: linter fix (validator + flipped test assertions, as ONE atomic PR) lands first; dependent file fixes land on top of main afterward. Opening per-file fixes first means CI rejects the correct pattern.

6. **Add pair-direction regression tests** so a future contributor with the same mental model can't flip the direction again:

   ```python
   def test_accepts_required_pattern(self):
       assert is_compliant("<required-pattern>")
   def test_rejects_prohibited_pattern(self):
       assert not is_compliant("<prohibited-pattern>")
   ```

7. **If META is also wrong** (e.g. CLAUDE.md says `--rebase` but branch protection disables rebase merge), the deployed config is ground truth — fix META first, then linter, then dependents. Confirm via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/<branch>/protection`.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Suppress C901 with `# noqa: C901` | Considered suppressing the complexity warning instead of refactoring | Project prohibits `--no-verify` and lint-rule suppression | Extract-method is the correct fix, not suppression |
| Inline all restore logic in one function | Added judgment + run_result restore as new `if` blocks in a function already at CC~8 | CC went to 11, exceeding the C901 limit of 10 | Check the CC budget before adding branches to a function near the limit |
| Contrive a test into an unreachable guard | First S101 for-else test used a `StopIteration` trick to hit the logically-unreachable `RuntimeError` guard | The guard cannot fire in normal operation; the trick was brittle and abandoned | Test observable adjacent behavior (normal exhausted-retry path), not the unreachable guard path |
| Skip the second pre-commit run | Ran `pre-commit` once after converting asserts | ruff-format reflowed the longer `raise RuntimeError(...)` lines and reported "files were modified" | The `if ... raise` form is longer than the assert; run pre-commit twice (reflow, then confirm clean) |
| Open N parallel PRs to fix N violating files | 2 separate PRs to fix `--rebase`->`--squash` in two skill files | The validator enforced the WRONG direction (required `--rebase`, rejected `--squash`); the new PRs would fail CI on the correct pattern | When >=2 files violate the same rule, the linter is the first suspect — read its rule definition before per-file PRs |
| Fix linter and dependent files in one PR | Considered bundling validator + all doc fixes into one mega-PR | Linter and doc changes have different test surfaces; bundling makes CI feedback ambiguous | Keep the linter fix as its own atomic PR; dependent fixes land afterward |
| Flip only the validator, not its tests | Planned to update validator code but leave its test suite | Validator tests still asserted the wrong direction — the linter PR itself fails CI | Validator source + its tests are one atomic change; flip both together |
| Single-direction regression test | Wrote a test asserting only "accepts `--squash`" | A future agent with the same wrong-direction model could re-flip the assertion and ship it | Pair tests: assert correct accepted AND wrong rejected, to prevent silent drift |
| Manual reorder of `__all__` with `as` aliases | Tried to alphabetize `__all__` entries and import block by hand when ruff reported RUF022 + I001 | isort orders by the **alias** name (the `as <name>` part), not the original symbol — naive alphabetical order of original names produces a different sequence that ruff still rejects | Always use `pixi run ruff check --fix <files>` for RUF022 and I001; these are `[*]`-fixable and the sort order is non-obvious when `as` aliases are present |

## Results & Parameters

### S101 conversions (verified)

```text
Issue #1066 / PR #1142: 16 asserts replaced (10 in runner.py, 6 in stages.py),
                        16 noqa removed, 3185 tests pass, 78.09% coverage (>=75%)
Issue #1143 / PR #1211: 4 remaining sites converted (workspace_manager.py x2,
                        llm_judge.py for-else, runner.py _finalize_test_summary),
                        4 regression tests added, 3261 tests pass, 78.39% coverage,
                        zero S101 suppressions remain in scylla/
```

Representative replacement messages: `"experiment_dir must be set before getting checkpoint path"`,
`"agent_result must be set before finalize_run"`, `"commit must be set before calling _checkout_commit"`,
`"Judge retry loop exhausted but last_parse_error is None"`,
`"_state must be initialized before finalizing test summary"`.

### C901 configuration

- **Ruff C901**: `max-complexity = 10` (in `pyproject.toml` lint config).
- **Custom hook**: `Check Cyclomatic Complexity` — runs separately from ruff at the same threshold; both must pass for CI green.
