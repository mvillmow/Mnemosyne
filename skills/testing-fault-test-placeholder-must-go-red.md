description: "Planning discipline for replacing a false-pass placeholder fault/chaos test (a hardcoded `pass`/`assert True` that never exercises the failure path) with a real one. Teaches: a fix is only credible if the new test can go RED (temporarily stub the recovery so it fails), proves recovery by an OBSERVABLE end-to-end effect (not by re-asserting design intent), and uses a clean SKIP — never a pass — where the fault is structurally inapplicable. Most importantly it catalogs the UNVERIFIED assumptions a planner makes when they write such a plan WITHOUT running code (does the client actually auto-reconnect? is the compose path right? does a hard-kill + same-port relaunch race? is the lifecycle helper idempotent?) so a reviewer knows exactly what to check. Use when: (1) planning a fix for an issue where a fault/chaos/resilience test is a hardcoded placeholder that always passes; (2) writing a NATS/broker crash-reconnect or kill-restart-recover test; (3) deciding skip-vs-fail semantics for an environment-conditional fault test; (4) reviewing such a plan and needing the high-risk assumptions enumerated; (5) any test that asserts a system property by re-reading source or restating design intent instead of exercising it."

# Fault-Test Placeholder Must Be Able To Go Red

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-19 |
| **Objective** | Plan a fix for a false-pass fault test: a NATS crash-reconnect e2e test that was a hardcoded `pass` placeholder (Odysseus e2e, GitHub issue #184) |
| **Outcome** | Produced an implementation plan (add `nats_kill`/`nats_restart` lifecycle helpers; kill -> degrade -> restart -> prove reconnect via a real task lifecycle). Plan only — never executed. |
| **Verification** | unverified (planning-discipline learning, no code run, no CI observed) |

## When to Use

- Planning a fix for an issue where a fault, chaos, or resilience test is a hardcoded placeholder (`pass`, `assert True`, `return 0`) that always passes without exercising the failure path.
- Writing a broker/NATS crash-reconnect or kill-restart-recover test for the first time.
- Deciding skip-vs-fail semantics for a fault test that only applies under some topologies/environments.
- Reviewing such a plan: this skill enumerates the high-risk unverified assumptions the planner relied on.
- Any test that "verifies" a property by re-reading source or restating design intent instead of exercising it.

## Verified Workflow

> **Warning:** This is a planning-discipline learning, not an executed workflow. Treat as a hypothesis until applied and confirmed.
> _(Proposed — derived from a plan that was never run; the assumptions below are unverified against code or CI.)_

### Quick Reference

```text
To fix a false-pass fault/chaos test, the plan MUST include:
  1. A way to exercise the REAL fault path (e.g. kill/restart lifecycle helpers).
  2. An explicit RED step: temporarily stub the recovery so the new test FAILS,
     proving it can detect a broken path. A test that cannot go red is a slower placeholder.
  3. A GREEN assertion that is an OBSERVABLE end-to-end effect (a brand-new task
     lifecycle completing AFTER restart) — never "asserts the system is designed for X".
  4. Clean SKIP (not pass) where the fault is structurally inapplicable for the topology.
  5. Conventions MIRRORED from the repo (existing kill helpers, compose service name,
     topology-gating precedent) — discovered by grep, not invented.
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Confirm the placeholder's sin.** The original test asserted design intent ("designed for graceful degradation") instead of exercising it. Re-asserting source or design is the same bug class you are fixing.
2. **Add a real fault path.** Introduce lifecycle helpers (`nats_kill`, `nats_restart`) that actually SIGKILL the broker and relaunch it, mirroring existing repo kill helpers found by grep rather than inventing a new style.
3. **Drive an observable effect.** After restart, run a brand-new end-to-end task lifecycle and assert it completes. Recovery is proven by the new work succeeding, not by re-reading config.
4. **Add the RED step.** Before trusting the test, temporarily stub/disable the recovery (e.g. do not restart, or break reconnect) and confirm the test FAILS. Only then revert and confirm GREEN. This is the single check that distinguishes a real test from a placeholder.
5. **Get skip-vs-fail semantics right.** "Structurally inapplicable" (the fault cannot occur in this topology) -> clean `skip_topology`/skip. "Should have worked but didn't" -> real fail. A pass where the fault cannot run is the same defect as the bug you are fixing.
6. **Mark the plan's assumptions.** Explicitly list every reliance that was NOT verified by running code (see Failed Attempts + Results) so a reviewer can check them before trusting the plan.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Hardcoded pass placeholder | Test body was `pass` / `assert True`, never exercising the fault | Always green; cannot detect a broken recovery path | A fault test that can never go red is a slower placeholder — add an explicit RED step |
| Assert design intent | Asserted "system is designed for graceful degradation" by re-reading source/config | Verifies the comment, not the behavior; passes even if recovery is broken | Prove recovery by an OBSERVABLE end-to-end effect (new task lifecycle completing post-restart) |
| Pass where inapplicable | Returned pass when the topology cannot exercise the fault | Same bug class as the placeholder — silently green without exercising anything | Use a clean skip for structurally-inapplicable cases; reserve fail for real breakage |
| Assume the client auto-reconnects | Plan relied on the NATS client reconnecting within timeout after restart, unverified | If the client does one-shot connect (KB warns nats-py `allow_reconnect` can hang / connect is one-shot) the post-restart lifecycle hangs and the "fix" is itself flaky/false | Verify reconnect behavior against the actual client code BEFORE trusting the plan (#1 risk) |
| Wrong relative compose path | Helper wrote `$(_e2e_root)/docker-compose.e2e.yml` | Compose file lives at repo ROOT, asserted from a single `find` hit; `_e2e_root()` returns `e2e/`, so the file is one level up | Correct path is `$(_e2e_root)/../docker-compose.e2e.yml`; a path from one `find` hit is brittle and was never executed |

## Results & Parameters

**Verification level: `unverified`.** This plan (for issue #184) was never executed; no code ran and no CI was observed. The value below is the catalog of assumptions a planner relied on WITHOUT running code — a reviewer MUST check these.

Uncertain assumptions / unverified reliances:

- **Compose path is brittle.** Asserted from a single `find` hit that `docker-compose.e2e.yml` lives at repo root. The in-helper code first wrote `$(_e2e_root)/docker-compose.e2e.yml` (WRONG) and needed correction to `$(_e2e_root)/../docker-compose.e2e.yml`. The T4 branch was never run.
- **Client auto-reconnect (#1 RISK).** Assumed Agamemnon's C++ `NatsClient` and the Python myrmidon auto-reconnect after the server restarts within the test timeout. NOT verified against client code. If either does a one-shot connect and never retries, the post-restart task lifecycle hangs/fails and the new test is itself flaky/false.
- **Hard-kill + same-store relaunch race.** Assumed the T1 background NATS relaunch with the SAME `--store_dir` cleanly re-attaches JetStream state and that no stale lock/PID prevents rebinding the same ports immediately after SIGKILL. Port-rebind races and JetStream store locks after a hard kill were not tested.
- **Lifecycle idempotency.** Assumed `run_task_lifecycle` is side-effect-safe to call twice in one run (baseline + post-restart) — i.e. creating a second agent/team/task does not collide. Not verified.
- **Runner invocation.** Assumed `pixi run bash e2e/run-ipc-tests.sh ...` is valid; the runner is documented as `bash e2e/run-ipc-tests.sh` and whether it is wrapped by pixi/just was not confirmed.
- **Line numbers drift.** Relied on point-in-time line numbers (`lib/process.sh:64-78`, `nats.sh:~108`, test lines 27-56) captured from one read; these will drift.

Risks a reviewer should focus on (ordered):

1. Does the actual NATS client auto-reconnect within timeout? Verify against Agamemnon `NatsClient` and myrmidon `main.py` before trusting the plan — if not, the new test is flaky/false.
2. T4 compose path correctness; that `compose stop nats` / `start nats` targets the right service and the monitor port maps through.
3. Hard-kill (SIGKILL) + immediate same-port/same-`store_dir` relaunch race on T1.
4. Idempotency of calling `run_task_lifecycle` twice.
5. Skip-vs-fail correctness for every topology — confirm no path silently passes without exercising the fault.
