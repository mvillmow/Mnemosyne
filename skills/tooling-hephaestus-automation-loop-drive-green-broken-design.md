description: "When `pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green` skips every loop or every repo ('SKIP not final loop' / 'SKIP no open issues') and leaves failing PRs untouched, the cause is FOUR layered design bugs in the loop runner, not operator error. Use issue-by-issue scoping (separate issues per bug) so the automation loop can fix them; use the documented bypass to drive PRs to green until then. Use when: (1) `--phases drive-green --loops N` SKIPs every iteration for N>1, (2) `--phases drive-green --loops 1` prints SKIP no open issues even though failing PRs exist, (3) operator asks 'how do I run drive-green only' or 'drive failing PRs to green ecosystem-wide', (4) calling `drive_prs_green.py` directly errors on the `--issues required` argument or the HEPH_LOOP_INDEX gate, (5) scoping audits for the loop-runner's phase model and PR-vs-issue discovery semantics."

# hephaestus-automation-loop `--phases drive-green` Is Structurally Broken

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-05-30 |
| **Objective** | Document the FOUR layered design bugs that make `pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green` unable to drive failing PRs to green for a normal operator, and capture the working bypass plus the proposed redesign filed as four issues. |
| **Outcome** | The failure modes (`SKIP not final loop`, `SKIP no open issues`) and the bypass via `drive_prs_green.py --force-run` were observed live on 2026-05-30. The redesign is filed as HomericIntelligence/ProjectHephaestus issues #818, #819, #820, #821; predecessor #817 closed as superseded. NOT YET SHIPPED. |
| **Verification** | verified-local - failure mode + bypass observed live in this session. Proposed redesign is unverified (issues are open). |

## When to Use

Trigger phrases that should hit this skill:

- `drive-green SKIP not final loop`
- `drive-green SKIP no open issues`
- "how do I run drive-green only"
- "drive failing PRs to green ecosystem-wide"
- "hephaestus-automation-loop skipped every iteration"
- "drive_prs_green.py --issues is required"
- "HEPH_LOOP_INDEX gate" / "HEPH_CI_DRIVER_FORCE=1"
- "drive-green doesn't see PRs without Closes #N"
- "drive-green doesn't see PRs assigned to someone else"

Trigger situations:

- Operator runs `pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green --repos R1,R2 --loops N` (any N) and watches every repo print `SKIP (not final loop)` or `SKIP (no open issues)` while failing PRs sit untouched.
- Operator tries to invoke `scripts/drive_prs_green.py` directly and hits `error: the following arguments are required: --issues` or exit 1 from the `HEPH_LOOP_INDEX != HEPH_TOTAL_LOOPS` gate.
- A `repo-analyze` or PR-review audit of `hephaestus/automation/loop_runner.py` or `hephaestus/automation/ci_driver.py` is in scope and the auditor needs the "this is broken; here are the four issues" canonical reference.
- Planning or grooming work in `HomericIntelligence/ProjectHephaestus` related to the loop runner's phase model, PR-vs-issue discovery, the `HEPH_LOOP_INDEX` env gate, or the `@me`-scoped issue query.

## Verified Workflow

> This section documents the ONLY working path TODAY (2026-05-30). The
> phase model and discovery semantics are broken; do not try to drive
> failing PRs through `pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases
> drive-green`. The proposed redesign is in the next section, but it
> has not shipped.

### Quick Reference - the working bypass

For a single repo with a known issue list:

```bash
cd /home/<you>/Projects/<repo>
pixi run python /home/<you>/Projects/ProjectHephaestus/scripts/drive_prs_green.py \
  --issues <N> <M> <O> --force-run
```

For ecosystem-wide operation, loop in bash (no `--repos`/`--org` pass-through on
the underlying script today):

```bash
ORG=HomericIntelligence
REPOS=(ProjectHephaestus ProjectMnemosyne ProjectKeystone)
HEPH_REPO=/home/<you>/Projects/ProjectHephaestus

for repo in "${REPOS[@]}"; do
  cd "/home/<you>/Projects/${repo}" || continue

  # Discover failing open PRs that have a `Closes #N` line, then extract N.
  issues=$(
    gh pr list --state open --json number,body,statusCheckRollup --limit 200 \
      --jq '
        .[]
        | select(
            (.statusCheckRollup // [])
            | map(.conclusion) | any(. == "FAILURE" or . == "CANCELLED" or . == "TIMED_OUT")
          )
        | .body
        | capture("Closes #(?<n>[0-9]+)").n
      ' | sort -u
  )

  [[ -z "$issues" ]] && { echo "[$repo] no failing PRs with Closes #N"; continue; }

  pixi run python "${HEPH_REPO}/scripts/drive_prs_green.py" \
    --issues $issues --force-run
done
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Confirm you are hitting the bug, not operator error.** Run with `--loops 1`
   to remove the not-final-loop gate:

   ```bash
   pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green \
     --repos <repo> --loops 1 2>&1 | grep -E "SKIP|drive-green"
   ```

   If the output is `[<repo>] phase drive-green SKIP (no open issues)` while
   `gh pr list --state open` shows failing PRs, you are inside Bug 2 (issue-based
   discovery) and/or Bug 4 (`@me` scope) - the runner cannot see the PRs at all.

2. **Do NOT increase `--loops`.** With `N > 1`, Bug 1 (not-final-loop gate) and
   the early-exit-on-zero-work convergence (`loop_runner.py:1108-1121`) combine
   to make every iteration `1..N-1` skip drive-green AND produce zero work, so
   early-exit fires before the final loop. The code is unreachable.

3. **Use the bypass.** Call `scripts/drive_prs_green.py` directly with
   `--force-run` (Bug 3 makes `--issues` required and adds a defensive
   `HEPH_LOOP_INDEX == HEPH_TOTAL_LOOPS` gate; `--force-run` or
   `HEPH_CI_DRIVER_FORCE=1` escapes it).

4. **Build the `--issues` list yourself.** Use the `gh pr list ... | jq capture("Closes #...")`
   one-liner above. PRs without `Closes #N`, PRs whose linked issue is closed,
   and PRs owned by other actors are invisible to the runner but the script
   itself accepts any issue number you hand it.

5. **Loop over repos in bash.** No `--repos` or `--org` flag exists on the
   underlying script; the loop-runner is the only consumer that knows how to
   iterate, and it is exactly what we are bypassing.

6. **File new findings under #818-#821, not as a fifth issue.** The four
   tracking issues already scope the bugs (#818 phase model, #819 discovery,
   #820 `--issues` + gate, #821 `@me` scope). If you find a fifth bug, open a
   new issue; do not amend an existing one.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green --loops 5` | Increased loop budget assuming "drive-green just runs on the last loop, so 5 loops should give it one shot." | Bug 1 + the early-exit-on-zero-work convergence (`loop_runner.py:918-924` + `1108-1121`) mean loops 1..4 skip drive-green AND produce zero work, so early-exit fires before loop 5. Unreachable code for N>1. | `--phases drive-green` with any N>1 is structurally unreachable today; the not-final-loop gate is a carve-out, not a per-loop semantic. |
| `pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green --loops 1` | Set `--loops 1` so every iteration IS the final loop. | Bug 2 + Bug 4: discovery calls `_list_open_issue_numbers(@me)`. Repos with failing PRs but no `@me`-authored OPEN ISSUES return an empty list and the runner prints `SKIP (no open issues)`. Observed live on 2026-05-30 against 7 open PRs - all 7 untouched. | The runner discovers WORK via the wrong primitive (issues, scoped to `@me`); it should discover PRs directly via `gh pr list --state open --json statusCheckRollup` filtered on failing conclusions. |
| `pixi run python scripts/drive_prs_green.py --issues 123` (no `--force-run`) | Called the underlying script directly, supplying the issue number, intending to skip the loop runner. | Bug 3: `ci_driver.py:984-990` keeps `--issues` `required=True` but ALSO enforces a defensive `HEPH_LOOP_INDEX == HEPH_TOTAL_LOOPS` env-var gate. Without those env vars set, the script exits 1 to prevent "running drive-green too early" - a check that exists only because the runner uses the same script for a partial phase. | Use `--force-run` (or `HEPH_CI_DRIVER_FORCE=1`) when invoking the script outside the loop runner. The env-var gate is a workaround for the loop runner's broken phase ordering, not an inherent script invariant. |
| `gh pr list ... --repos R1,R2` then expect `drive_prs_green.py --repos` | Looked for a `--repos` or `--org` pass-through on the underlying script so the bypass could iterate without bash. | The script takes a single repo from `cwd` (assumes you `cd` first); there is no `--repos`/`--org`/`--cwd` flag today. Only the loop runner knows how to iterate repos. | Ecosystem-wide bypass requires a bash loop. Do not patch this into `drive_prs_green.py` ad-hoc; the structural fix is to let the loop runner call drive-green correctly (issue #818). |
| Adding `Closes #<fake>` lines to PRs to make them discoverable | Considered editing PR bodies of the 7 untouched PRs to add Closes-references to keep the runner happy. | Bug 2 means even WITH `Closes #N`, the link is only honored if N is OPEN AND authored / assigned to `@me` (Bug 4). Fabricating links also pollutes the issue tracker and breaks audit. | Don't paper over the broken discovery model. The fix is PR-based discovery via `gh pr list ... statusCheckRollup` (issue #819), not editing PR bodies. |

## Results & Parameters

### The four bugs (one issue each, do not collapse)

| # | Issue | Module | Line range | Root cause |
| ----- | ------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1 | #818 | `hephaestus/automation/loop_runner.py` | 77-81 + 918-924 + 1108-1121 | `drive-green` is in `ALL_PHASES` (per-loop) but conditionally skipped on non-final loops; combined with zero-work early-exit it is unreachable for `--loops N>1`. Move to `ALL_POST_LOOP_STAGES = ("drive-green",)` that runs ONCE per repo after the loop, INCLUDING when early-exit fires. |
| 2 | #819 | `hephaestus/automation/loop_runner.py` | `_list_open_issue_numbers` callsite at `:901` | Discovery walks open issues, not failing PRs. Replace with `gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,statusCheckRollup,mergeable,author --limit 200` filtered to `statusCheckRollup[].conclusion in {FAILURE,CANCELLED,TIMED_OUT}` or `mergeStateStatus == BLOCKED`. |
| 3 | #820 | `hephaestus/automation/ci_driver.py` | 983-990 | `--issues` declared `required=True, nargs="+"`; defensive `HEPH_LOOP_INDEX == HEPH_TOTAL_LOOPS` gate escapable only via `--force-run` / `HEPH_CI_DRIVER_FORCE=1`. Make `--issues` optional (PR-discovery mode when omitted); delete the env gate once the loop runner stops misusing `HEPH_LOOP_INDEX` as a permission token. |
| 4 | #821 | `hephaestus/automation/loop_runner.py` | `_list_open_issue_numbers` body | Hardcoded union of `--author @me` + `--assignee @me`. For PRs, the right primitive is "PRs I can push to." Add an `--all` opt-in flag that widens the discovery to PRs owned by other actors. |

Predecessor combined issue #817 closed as superseded - DO NOT REOPEN.

### Live repro on 2026-05-30 (verified-local)

```text
$ pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green \
    --repos ProjectHephaestus,ProjectMnemosyne --loops 1
[ProjectMnemosyne] phase drive-green SKIP (no open issues)
[ProjectHephaestus] phase drive-green SKIP (no open issues)
Completed 1 of 1 loop(s) across 2 repo(s).
# 7 open PRs across the two repos, untouched.
```

### Expected output of the bypass (single repo)

```text
$ pixi run python /home/<you>/Projects/ProjectHephaestus/scripts/drive_prs_green.py \
    --issues 612 614 --force-run
# Resolves each issue -> PR via `Closes #N`.
# Launches one CI-driver agent per resolved PR.
# Each agent: read failing checks, propose fix, push to PR head, watch CI to green.
```

### What "should" land (proposed redesign - NOT YET SHIPPED)

> NOT VERIFIED. This is the design captured in issues #818-#821; the
> implementation has not been merged. Treat as the target shape, not as
> instructions to run today.

```python
# loop_runner.py - phase model
ALL_PHASES = ("plan", "implement")
ALL_POST_LOOP_STAGES = ("drive-green",)  # runs once per repo after the loop body,
                                          # INCLUDING when zero-work early-exit fires.

# drive_prs_green.py - discovery & flags
parser.add_argument("--issues", nargs="+", required=False)  # optional
parser.add_argument("--all", action="store_true",
                    help="Include PRs from actors other than @me.")
# When --issues omitted: discover failing PRs directly via
#   gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,statusCheckRollup,
#               mergeable,author,isCrossRepository --limit 200
# Filter to PRs where any check has conclusion in {FAILURE,CANCELLED,TIMED_OUT}
# OR mergeStateStatus == BLOCKED. Default scope: @me-authored. --all widens.
# Delete HEPH_LOOP_INDEX gate and --force-run escape hatch.
```

### Trigger-phrase index (for `/advise` discovery)

These phrases SHOULD route to this skill; if they don't, file a marketplace tag:

- `drive-green SKIP not final loop`
- `drive-green SKIP no open issues`
- `how do I run drive-green only`
- `drive failing PRs to green ecosystem-wide`
- `drive-green doesn't see my failing PR`
- `drive_prs_green.py --issues is required`
- `HEPH_LOOP_INDEX gate`
- `HEPH_CI_DRIVER_FORCE`
- `hephaestus-automation-loop SKIPs every loop`

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| ProjectHephaestus | Live session 2026-05-30: ran `pixi run hephaestus-automation-loop --phases drive-green --repos ProjectHephaestus,ProjectMnemosyne --loops 1` against 7 open PRs; observed `SKIP (no open issues)` from both repos and 0 PRs touched. | Issues #818, #819, #820, #821 (predecessor #817 closed superseded). |
| ProjectHephaestus | Same session: verified bypass `pixi run python scripts/drive_prs_green.py --issues <N> --force-run` works by reading argparse + `HEPH_CI_DRIVER_FORCE` handling at `hephaestus/automation/ci_driver.py:983-990`. | Bypass is the only working path until #818-#821 land. |
